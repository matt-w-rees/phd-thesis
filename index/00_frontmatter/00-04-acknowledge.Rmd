I acknowledge and pay respect to the Gunditjmara and Eastern Maar people on whose traditional lands this study took place. I also completed this PhD while living on Wurundjeri, Bundjalung and Larrakia country, I extend my respect to their elders, past and present. 

I firstly wish to thank my supervisor Bronwyn Hradksy, who has been a valuable source of wisdom and guidance throughout this project. Bron gave me the freedom to pursue my own interests, but gently reigned me in as I became distracted by the many shiny things along the way. She has been influential in shaping the early stages of my career and my attitude to applied conservation research, for which I am grateful. In many respects this PhD has felt like a partnership and I reckon Bron might even be more stoked than me to see this finished. Thank you Bron. 

To my other supervisors, Brendan Wintle and Alan Robley. Brendan, thank you for helping me to see the bigger picture of my research and the being the authority when hard decisions needed to be made. To Al, thank you for navigating me through world of fox control, lining up equipment and sharing copius amounts of data; your help has been instrumental in allowing this project to reach its potential. While not my supervisor on paper, Jack Pascoe helped shape this PhD, provided generous assistance along the way, and importantly, always told it like it was&mdash;thanks Jack.  

To my PhD committee, Michael McCarthy, Natalie Briscoe and Richard Hill, thank you. Ten minutes with Mick's ideas was enough to run on for a year, Nat gave advice which fundamentally shifted my attitude to this PhD, Richard ensured my work was useful and was incredibly helpful in reminding me to not stress and enjoy the research. 

Thanks to both the Glenelg Ark and Otway Ark fox control programs for helping shape my research questions, providing advice, logistical support and sharing data. In particular, a big thanks to the folks at the Heywood DELWP office for always being incredibly supportive of my research, up for a laugh and letting me raid the equipment storage. Special thanks to David Pitts, Wes Burns, Thoman McKinnon, Louise Falls and Ethan Le Duc. 

None of my research in the Otway Ranges would have been remotely feasible without support from the Conservation Ecology Centre. Thanks to Lizzie Corke and Shayne Neal for making this possible. Thank you to Mark Le Pla and Emma Birnbaum for your partnership, enthusiasm, competence and friendship throughout this project. A big thank you to the CEC interns who were basically angels sent from heaven to help me in the field: Shauni Omond, Asitha Samarawickrama, Shelley Thompson, Erin Harris, Hannah Killian, Ben Lake, Chantelle Geissler, Aviya Naccarella, Nina Page and Maggie Campbell-Jones. Working alongside the entire Conservation Ecology Centre crew was a clear highlight of my PhD.

I am proud of the large dataset this PhD has amassed because of the hard work of many field volunteers. Thank you Lani Watson, Mark Dorman, Jack Davis, Carl Roffey, Bruce Edley, Larissa Oliveira Gon√ßalves, Annie Hobby, Louise Falls, Jimmy Downie, Marney Hradsky, Stephanie Samson, Robin Sinclair, Asmaa Alhusainan, Kelly Forrester, Tammana Wadawani, Emily Gregg, Hannah Edwards, Adam Beck, Vishnu Memnon, Sandy Lu, Pia Lentini, Nick Golding, Emily McColl-Gausden, Nina Page, Maggie Campbell-Jones, Kyle Quinn and Jack Dickson, but mainly Emily Gronow who was promised a fun trip but instead spent days changing camera batteries (sorry Emily). 

I am grateful to Vin and Kelly Gannon who gave me a home away from home while out in the field, and even some much needed employment in the Glenelg region.

My thesis is largely a product of the many great minds and close friends in the QAEco lab. From the many people who went above and beyond in providing coding and statistical help, from the most basic to niche of problems. There were some computational ruts I would never have made it out of without the help of Nick Golding, Jian Yen, Casey Visintin, Saras Windecker, David Wilkinson and Roozbeh Valavi in particular. To those who gave advice, or at least sympathised as I navigated the foreign world of academia (especially Pia Lentini; particularly when over a beer). But most importantly, Pauline Byron and Dolla Boutros, the glue that holds QAEco together. Thank you all. 

Thanks to my good mate and PhD companion, the ever-reliable Billy Geary. Billy even provided some excellent writing suggestions for the General Introduction and Chapter 4. 

Taking on this PhD meant I spent less time with my friends and loved ones. To those who wore this cost with understanding and support, thank you. In particular, my partner Cara. 

Lastly, I wish to thank my parents, Kim and Malcolm. Who, in no way instilled any environmental or academic aspirations, but could not have been more supportive nonetheless. Mum and Dad gave me food and shelter when I ran out of funding and needed to escape endless pandemic lockdowns, making it possible for me to finish this thesis.

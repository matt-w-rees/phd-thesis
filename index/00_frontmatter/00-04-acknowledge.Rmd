I acknowledge and pay respect to Gunditjmara and Eastern Maar (in particular, the Gadubanud) Peoples on whose traditional lands this study took place. Spending time on, and learning about these cultural landscapes has been a life changing experience. I really hope this work can help minimise damage from these predators we introduced onto country. I also completed this PhD while living on Wurundjeri, Bundjalung and Larrakia country, I extend my respect to their elders, past and present. 

I firstly wish to thank my supervisor Bronwyn Hradsky, who has been a valuable source of wisdom and guidance throughout this project. She has been influential in shaping the early stages of my career and my attitude to applied conservation research, for which I am grateful. In many respects this PhD has felt like a partnership&mdash;I reckon Bron might even be more stoked than me to see this finished. Thank you Bron. 

To my other supervisors, Brendan Wintle and Alan Robley. Brendan, thank you for helping me to see the bigger picture of my research and the being the authority when hard decisions needed to be made. To Al, thank you for helping me navigate the world of fox control, lining up equipment and sharing copious amounts of data; your help has been instrumental in allowing this project to reach its potential. While not my supervisor on paper, Jack Pascoe helped shape this PhD, provided generous assistance along the way and importantly, always told it like it was&mdash;thanks Jack.  

To my PhD committee, Michael McCarthy, Natalie Briscoe and Richard Hill, thank you. Ten minutes with Mick's ideas was enough to run on for a year, Nat gave advice which fundamentally shifted my attitude to this PhD, Richard helped ensure my work was relevant to managers and reminded me stop stressing and enjoy the research. 

Thanks to both the Glenelg Ark and Otway Ark fox control programs for helping shape my research questions, providing advice, logistical support and sharing data. In particular, a big thanks to the folks at the Heywood DELWP office for always being incredibly supportive of my research, up for a laugh and letting me raid the equipment storage. Special thanks to David Pitts, Wes Burns, Thomas McKinnon, Louise Falls and Ethan Le Duc. 

Working alongside the Conservation Ecology Centre was a highlight of this PhD; none of my research in the Otway Ranges would have been remotely feasible without their support. Thanks to Lizzie Corke and Shayne Neal for making this possible. Thank you to Mark Le Pla and Emma Birnbaum for your partnership, enthusiasm, competence and friendship throughout this project. A big thank you to the CEC interns who assisted me in the field: Shauni Omond, Asitha Samarawickrama, Shelley Thompson, Erin Harris, Hannah Killian, Ben Lake, Chantelle Geissler, Aviya Naccarella, Nina Page and Maggie Campbell-Jones. 

I am proud of the large dataset this PhD has amassed because of the hard work of many field volunteers. Thank you Lani Watson, Mark Dorman, Jack Davis, Carl Roffey, Bruce Edley, Larissa Oliveira Gonçalves, Annie Hobby, Louise Falls, Jimmy Downie, Marney Hradsky, Stephanie Samson, Robin Sinclair, Asmaa Alhusainan, Kelly Forrester, Tammana Wadawani, Emily Gregg, Hannah Edwards, Adam Beck, Vishnu Memnon, Sandy Lu, Pia Lentini, Nick Golding, Emily McColl-Gausden, Nina Page, Maggie Campbell-Jones, Kyle Quinn and Jack Dickson, but mainly Emily Gronow, who I promised a fun trip to, but who instead spent days changing camera batteries (sorry Emily). 

On the contrary, Zoï Banikos never repaid me for my fieldwork contributions to her masters thesis, despite promising to do so. Nonetheless, the first couple years of my PhD were the hardest and working alongside Zoï made it a bit more bearable. I am pleasantly surprised neither of us perished in the Otway rainforests and we made it through our over-ambitious field campaigns together. 

I am grateful to Vin and Kelly Gannon who gave me a home away from home while in the field, and even some much needed employment in the Glenelg region.

It is difficult to articulate the many and varied contributions of the greater QAEco lab to my PhD experience. Many people went above and beyond in providing coding, statistical and broader research support, from the most basic to niche of problems. There were some computational ruts I would never have made it out of without help, particularly from Nick Golding, Jian Yen, Casey Visintin, Saras Windecker, David Wilkinson and Roozbeh Valavi. I am grateful for the friendships and advice received as I clumsily navigated the foreign world of academia (particularly when over a beer; especially with Pia Lentini). I am most thankful to Pauline Byron and Dolla Boutros, without who I may have died in a sea of administration. 

Thanks to my good mate and PhD companion, the ever-reliable William Geary. Billy even provided some excellent suggestions which improved the General Introduction and Chapter 4. 

Taking on this PhD meant I spent less time with my friends and loved ones. To those who wore this cost with understanding and support, thank you. 

Lastly, I wish to thank my parents, Kim and Malcolm. Who, in no way instilled any environmental or academic aspirations, but could not have been more supportive nonetheless. Mum and Dad gave me food and shelter when I ran out of funding and needed to escape endless pandemic lockdowns, making it possible for me to finish this thesis.

I acknowledge and pay respect to the Gunditjmara and Eastern Maar (in particular, the Gadabunud) people on whose traditional lands this study took place. I feel extremely grateful to have had the chance to learn about and work across these countries, which have some of longest histories of management which continue to this day--I hope this research can help in some small way. I also completed this PhD while living on Wurundjeri, Bundjalung and Larrakia country, I also extend my respect to their elders, past and present. 

I firstly wish to thank my supervisors Bronwyn Hradksy, Brendan Wintle and Alan Robley. Bron was incredibly generous with her time when I started this project but gave the freedom to find and pursue my own interests, reigning me in when I became occasionally distracted by shiny things. Thanks to Brendan for helping me to see the bigger picture of my research. And to Al, thanks for guiding me through world of fox control, lining up equipment and sharing copius amounts of data--it is painful to imagine what my thesis would have been without this support. Jack Pascoe was not my PhD supervisor on paper, but helped shape my project and provided tangible assistance and guidance along the way. 

To my PhD committee, Mick McCarthy, Nat Briscoe and Richard Hill. Ten minutes with Micks ideas was enough to run on for a year. Nat gave me advice which fundamentally shifted my attitude to this PhD. Richard ensured my work was useful to local managers and was incredibly helpful in reminding me to not stress and enjoy the research. Thank you!

Thanks to both the Glenelg Ark and Otway Ark fox control programs for helping to shape my research questions, providing advice and sharing datasets. A big thanks to the legends of the Heywood DELWP office for being incredibly supportive of my research, always being up for a laugh and letting me raid the equipment storage. Special thanks go to Pittsy, Wes, Tom, Louise and Ethan. I am extremely thankful to Vin and Kelly Gannon who gave me a home away from home (and even some employment) in the Glenelg region. None of my research in the Otways would have been remotely feasible without the huge support I received from the Conservation Ecology Centre. Working alongside the entire CEC crew was a highlight of my PhD, particularly thanks to Jack, Mark Le Pla and Emma Birnbaum. 

Thank you to my field assistants for making this data collection possible: Shauni Omond, Shayne Neal, Asitha Samarawickrama, Shelley Thompson, Erin Harris, Hannah Killian, Lani Watson, Mark Dorman, Jack Davis, Carl Roffey, Bruce Edley, Larissa Oliveira Gonçalves, Ben Lake, Chantelle Geissler, Aviya Naccarella, Emily Gronow, Harley England, David Pitts, Annie Hobby, Louise Falls, Thomas McKinnon, Jimmy Downie, Marney Hradsky, Stephanie Samson, Robin Sinclair, Asmaa Alhusainan, Kelly Forrester, Tammana Wadawani, Emily Gregg, Hannah Edwards,Adam Beck, Vishnu Memnon, Sandy Lu, Pia Lentini, Nick Golding, Emily McColl-Gausden, Nina Page, Maggie Campbell-Jones, Kyle Quinn and Jack Dickson. 

My thesis is a product of the many great minds and close friends in the QAEco lab. I knocked on many a door for coding and statistics help, as well as general advice on navigating the very foreign world of research--everyone always went above and beyond. I am very thankfully this community persisted during pandemic lockdowns. 
I particularly wish to thank the almighty QAEco leaders - Pauline Byron and Dolla Boutros. 

Thanks to my good mate, the ever-reliable Billy Geary, who is always available when I needed a whinge, discuss results, methods, plots and even comment on drafts.

Thanks to my partner Cara, for your constant understanding, support and patience. 

Lastly, I wish to thank my parents, Kim and Malcolm, who did not instil my environmental or academic interests in anyway, but could not have been more supportive nonetheless. Mum and Dad gave me food and shelter when I ran out of funding and needed to escape pandemic lockdowns -- I genuinely could not have finished this PhD without their support.

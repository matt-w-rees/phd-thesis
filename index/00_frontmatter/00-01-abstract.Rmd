Invasive predators are a major driver of global biodiversity loss. Accordingly, lethal invasive predator control is a common conservation strategy. However, despite usually being faced with multiple invasive predators, managers often implement targeted control of one species at a time due to feasibility constraints. There is concern that singular invasive predator control leads to a 'mesopredator release' of subordinate predators, through relaxation via direct top-down pressure and indirect competition. An invasive mesopredators release could dampen or even worsen conservation outcomes. While intuitive, evidence for mesopredator release is weak due to a lack of robust experimental designs and replication, as well as reliance on activity indices. 

In this thesis, I investigated whether the lethal control of an apex invasive predator (red fox *Vulpes vulpes*) has led to a mesopredator release of a widespread subordinate invasive predator (feral cat *Felis catus*). I replicated field experiments and collated additional camera-trapping data across two regions with a simple predator guild comprising the introduced red fox and feral cat, allowing sharp focus on interactions between these species. Glenelg region with long-term fox control, Control-Impact with three replicates. Otway Ranges, BACIPS. I quantified impacts of fox control on two threatened native marsupials and assessed evidence for a mesopredator release of feral cats using multiple population metrics: site occurrence, spatiotemporal behaviour and population density. 

Fox occurrence strongly declined across the gradient of 1080 poison-bait density; the maximum of 20 baits deployed in a foxes home range reduced fox occurrence by 70% consistently across both regions. However, this had basically no impact on southern brown bandicoot *Isoodon obesulus* occurrence. Long-nosed potoroo *Potorous tridactylus* occurrence increased with long-term fox-bait density in the Glenelg region, but decreased slightly in the Otway Ranges where fox control had recently commenced. Rather than being limited by foxes, habitat suitability for these threatened mammals was more strongly driven by an interaction between vegetation type and time since fire. However, not only do optimal fire regimes vary across species, but they can be entirely conflicting for the same species across different vegetation communities. 

At a landscape scale (mean size: 169 km^2^), lethal fox control was associated with a range of responses from a negligible to 3.7-fold increase in feral cat density. Consistent with the mesopredator release hypothesis, the degree of increase corresponded with variation in the duration and intensity of fox suppression. At a fine spatial scale (200 m), feral cat density had a consistent negative association with fox occurrence across both regions. Individual cat detectability and movement also varied across the (artificially manipulated) fox occurrence gradient. Using a larger dataset without individual identification, I saw no evidence that foxes impacted the occurrence of cats, in fact, these predators were more likely to co-occur than not in the Glenelg region. Instead, feral cats seemed to avoid foxes by shifting diel activity patterns. Where foxes are nocturnal in the Glenelg region dry vegetation types of the Otway Ranges, cats became more active during the the day where fox activity was highest. In the wet vegetation types of the Otway Ranges where foxes were active consistently throughout the daily cycle; cats concentrated activity around midnight where fox activity was highest.

Another paragraph on the drivers of invasive predator occurrence and diel activity?

My thesis provides replicated, experimental evidence that that apex predator suppression is associated with an increase in the density of a mesopredator. Mesopredator release can manifest as changes in both behaviour and density, distorting inference if these processes are not distinguished. Further, joint spatiotemporal models are required to adequately understand predator interactions. I provide an easily implementable, hierarchical generalised additive model framework to investigate spatiotemporal changes in species detections and share information across different contexts. Our results help explain why fox control did not consistently improve southern brown bandicoot and long-nosed potoroo occurrence, suggesting integrated pest management may be necessary to improve conservation outcomes. Until thats feasible, maintaining habitat structure through careful use prescribed fire is a priority.

Predators can have devastating impacts on native biodiversity when introduced beyond their native range, and so, are often lethally controlled. However, predator control can backfire if it frees a subordinate invasive predator from top-down suppressive and competitive effects, referred to as ‘mesopredator release’. Although, there is considerable uncertainty around the mesopredator release hypothesis and integrated pest management is often not feasible. 

Lethal control of the introduced red fox *Vulpes vulpes* is a common conservation strategy in Australia. While not often monitored, there have been reports of dramatic declines in native prey species following long-term fox control, often blamed on a mesopredator release of the (more difficult to manage) feral cat *Felis catus*. However, evidence for a mesopredator release of feral cats is weak, mainly due to a lack of robust experimental designs with replication and a reliance on activity indices which cannot disentangle the observation process, behavioural and numerical population responses.

My thesis investigates whether lethal red fox control causes a mesopredator release of feral cats in temperate south-eastern Australia. Here, foxes and feral cats are the only large-medium sized terrestrial predators, allowing sharp focus on the interactions between these species. I tested feral cat responses to fox control from several different angles: changes in (i) distribution, (ii) population density and (iii) behaviour. Across south-west Victoria, I conducted a thrice replicated control-impact design across a long-term (~10 years) fox control program, and a before-after control-impact paired series design in another region with recently commenced (0 – 2 years) fox control. I surveyed mammal communities with 949 camera-trap deployments and collated data from an additional 2718 camera-traps deployed by government research partners. I used Bayesian occupancy-detection models, generalised additive models, and spatial mark-resight models to investigate fox control effects and account for other drivers of invasive predator and threatened native prey populations: fire, vegetation, rainfall, fragmentation. 

Fox suppression was a function of spatiotemporal control effort. Fox occurrence declined across gradients of poison-bait density--strongly in the region with long-term fox control, but relatively weakly in the the region with shorter-term and less frequent fox control. Across both regions, fox occupancy probability declined with time since fire and distance to areas of non-native vegetation for 1.5 km into the forest interior, and was lowest in the wet forests relative to dry vegetation types. 

Feral cat density increased with fox control; the strength of this effect depended on strength of fox suppression (feral cat density was negatively associated with fine-scale fox occurrence probability). There was weak, inconclusive evidence that feral cat occupancy increased with fox control, perhaps because cats tended to range further and be less detectable where foxes were likely to occur. Spatial coexistence between cats and foxes was probably facilitated by cats altering temporal activity--we observed complete shifts in diel behaviour from mostly nocturnal to mostly diurnal activity where fox activity was highest. Feral cats had low detection rates and weak responses to most other explanatory variables (except for vegetation type), making them particularly elusive. In contrast to expectations in the literature, my estimates of feral cat density in rainforests and wet forests the highest recorded in Australian mainland ‘natural environments’. 

A mesopredator release of feral cats may explain why fox control offered no reprieve for southern brown bandicoots *Isoodon obesulus*, a threatened native mammal preyed on by both red foxes and feral cats.  Nevertheless, long-term fox control provides a strong benefit to the long-nosed potoroo *Potorous tridactylus*, another shared, threatened prey species. Different responses of prey species to fox control likely reflects species-specific variability in susceptibility to foxes relative to cats – a priority for future research. 

My thesis provides relatively robust evidence for the mesopredator release hypothesis. Fine-scale changes in mesopredator behaviour following apex predator decline can distort inference around numerical and spatial population changes if these processes are not separated. Further replicated experimental designs paired with spatial capture-recapture methods are likely to increase clarity around this contentious hypothesis.

Predators can have devastating impacts on biodiversity when introduced beyond their native range, and so are often lethally controlled. However, control of a dominant invasive predator can backfire if it frees subordinate invasive predators from top-down suppressive and competitive effects; this process is referred to as ‘mesopredator release’. Identifying whether mesopredator release is occurring is important, particularly as integrated management of co-occurring invasive predators is often costly or infeasible.
 
Lethal control of the introduced red fox *Vulpes vulpes* (hereafter ‘fox’) is a common conservation strategy in Australia. However, there have been reports of dramatic declines in native prey species following fox control. These declines are often attributed to mesopredator release of the feral cat *Felis catus* (hereafter ‘cat’), which is less commonly managed. However, evidence for mesopredator release of cats following fox control is weak, mainly due to a lack of robust, replicated experimental designs, and a reliance on activity indices to monitor predator responses to control.  Such indices are likely biased by relaxation of antipredator behaviours following mesopredator release, skewing inference around numerical population responses.

The primary aim of my thesis was to test whether lethal fox control causes a mesopredator release of cats, in terms of cat (i) population density, (ii) occurrence, and (iii) behaviour. As part of this, I also derived the first estimates of cat density for wet forest environments in Australia.  I also investigated the influence of fox control (1080 poison-baiting), fire, vegetation type, rainfall and habitat fragmentation on the occurrence of the invasive predators and two threatened native prey species at a regional scale.
 
My study was conducted across two regions in temperate south-eastern Australia. Here, foxes and cats are the only large-medium sized terrestrial predators, allowing sharp focus on the interactions between these species.  In one region, I used a replicated control-impact design across a long-term (8 - 14 years) fox control program. In the other, I used a before-after control-impact paired series design around a new fox control program (0 - 2 years). I led the deployment of 949 camera traps (63,560 trap nights) to survey mammal communities and identify 133 individual feral cats, as well as collated data from an additional 2718 camera-traps deployed by government research partners. 
 
I found that fox suppression success varied with spatial and temporal variation in control effort. Fox occurrence declined across gradients of poison-bait density--strongly in the region with long-term fox control, but relatively weakly in the region with shorter-term and less frequent fox control. Across both regions, the probability of fox occurrence declined with time since fire and distance to non-native vegetation up to 1.5 km into the forest interior; fox occupancy was also lower in wet forests than drier vegetation types. 
 
In contrast to expectations from the literature, my estimates of feral cat density in rainforests and wet forests were the highest recorded in Australian mainland ‘natural environments’, even in the absence of fox control. At a landscape level, cat density increased with fox control; the strength of this effect depended on the degree of fox suppression. Cat density was also negatively associated with the probability of fox occurrence at a fine spatial scale, which also impacted cat detectability. Evidence that cat occurrence changed with fox control or fox occurrence probability was inconclusive. Cats shifted to more diurnal activity patterns when fox activity was high in dry vegetation types, potentially facilitating spatial coexistence. 
 
Long-term fox control appeared strongly beneficial to the long-nosed potoroo *Potorous tridactylus*, a threatened native mammal preyed on by both red foxes and feral cats.  However, fox control was not associated with an increase in occurrence of the southern brown bandicoot *Isoodon obesulus*, another shared, threatened prey species. Mesopredator release of feral cats in terms of their density and behaviour, and species-specific variability in susceptibility to foxes relative to cats, may explain why native prey species differ in their responses to fox control. Further work is needed to understand implications for other native prey, particularly small native mammals. that are particularly vulnerable to cat predation. In systems with multiple invasive predators, understanding the implications of mesopredator release is fundamental to achieving effective biodiversity conservation. 
 
My approach of replicated experimental designs and use of statistical methods that distinguish behavioural processes from numerical population changes provides some of the most robust evidence for the mesopredator release of feral cats following fox control in Australia. My thesis highlights that mesopredator release can manifest in different ways and can be difficult to diagnose with simplistic metrics (e.g., average co-occurrence or activity overlap). Importantly, however, I demonstrate that replicated methods across different ecosystems show broadly similar patterns of mesopredator release—a key step forward in this contentious hypothesis.

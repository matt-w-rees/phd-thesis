**Thesis overview**

This is a thesis with publication and comprises four 'data' chapters that present my PhD research (Chapters 2 - 5). Chapter 2 has been published in a peer-reviewed journal, with Chapters 3, 4 & 5 currently being peer-reviewed. Accordingly, each chapter is a standalone work, with enough detail to allow them to be viewed independently. This means there is some repetition between chapters, particularly in methods sections. The pronoun ‘we’ is used instead of ‘I’ in recognition of the co-authors’ contributions to these data chapters. 

The General Introduction provides a brief overview of the relevant literature and outlines the key themes underlying the research, while the Synthesis describes links between the papers, discussing management implications and future research priorities.

**Contributions**

I am the primary author and principal contributor on all chapters (i.e., I have contributed greater than 50% effort) which I completed for the purpose of this degree. I led the design, collection and collation of the data, conducted all statistical analyses and led the writing of each chapter. 

Alongside fieldwork volunteers, I led the deployment 425 camera-traps in the Glenelg region during 2018 (a control-impact experiment two spatial replicates), and 524 camera-trap deployments (195 unique sites) in a Before-After-Control-Impact-Paired-Series design in the western Otway Ranges annually from 2017 - 2019. I identified species and 133 individual cats from this dataset, with secondary cat identifications by Mark Le Pla, Emma Birnbaum, Bronwyn Hradsky and Luke Woodford.

Chapter \@ref(otways17) uses a subset of this dataset: my 2017 camera-trap deployments in the Otway Ranges. For the remaining data chapters, my dataset was used in its entirety as well as supplemented with the following datasets:

+ Chapters \@ref(occ) and \@ref(diel) include an additional 1,616 camera-trap deployments from the Glenelg Ark fox control monitoring program (240 unique sites surveyed annually 2013-19) and 1,113 from the Otway Ark fox control monitoring program (372 unique sites surveyed annually 2016-18). 

+ Chapter \@ref(density) includes an additional dataset from the Lower Glenelg National Park (113 camera-traps; serving as a third spatial replicate for the Control-Impact experimental design). Alan Robley designed this camera-trap layout, Ethan Le Duc, Michael Murrell, Dylan Thomas, Rhys Weber, Chris Johansson, Lachlan Levings and Liz Beever carried out the surveys, with Luke Woodford identifying cats (all from the Victorian Government Department of Environment, Land, Water and Planning). 

This thesis was written in R Markdown and Bookdown using the 'unimelbdown' template created by Luke Zappia [@unimelbdown2018].

## Introduction

Diel activity patterns - the distribution of activity throughout the daily cycle - are an important but overlooked aspect of behavioural ecology. Animals must allocate particular times of the day to rest, forage, socialise and reproduce, which are traded-off against threat avoidance (e.g. predation) and deterrence against resource loss (i.e. inter and intraspecific competition). Diel activity can therefore vary spatially across different environmental conditions (e.g. food, shelter availability) and species assemblages. This is important to understand because constrained diel activity can incur fitness costs to individuals and populations (Lamb 2020 PNAS).

Flexible spatiotemporal behaviour can allow animals to adapt to changing conditions. For example, elk in Yellowstone National Park use risky, open parts of the landscape when the activity of reintroduced wolves is low, suggesting coexistence without major fitness costs (Kohl et al. 2019). Diel activity decisions are clearly linked to habitat type, and there is growing recognition of individual-level variation in these decisions (Basille et al 2015; time-limited seabirds; urban bears). Populations with high individual heterogeneity in diel behaviour are likely to be more adaptable to threats (Wolf and Weissing 2012; Dingemanse and Wolf 2013). 

Diel activity patterns are increasingly being considered as technology like telemetry devices and camera-traps have become more widely available. Telemetry devices like GPS collars and accelerometers provide high resolution data at the individual-level. However, resource constraints generally limit these studies to few individuals (Harmsen 2009), which target personalities susceptible to physical capture. Camera-traps are particularly useful because they provide a more balanced view of the entire population and can detect multiple species, providing inference on ecological differences and species interactions. However, individual-level inference would be limited to species with unique markings. Distiller et al 2020 recently used camera-traps to individually identify jaguars and estimate sex difference in diel activity patters. Despite having information on individual diel activity patterns, studies predominantly estimate at the population-level due to small sample sizes. Most studies examine spatiotemporal behavioural responses by repeating spatial analyses at different time periods (predominantly night and day), but few consider continuous shifts in diel activity across spatial contexts. 

A variety of statistical approaches are used to model continuous diel activity patterns, and examine how they vary among habitat types, individuals and co-occurring species. Kernel density estimation is most commonly used [@ridout2009estimating], despite being susceptible to noise from small sample sizes [@iannarilli2019lorelograms] and not incorporating explanatory variables [@frey2017investigating]. Kernel density estimation remains popular because largely because they provide a coefficient which describes the estimated overlap between two diel curves. However, rarely are there only two interacting species or two categorical contexts for one species. To account for the spatiotemporal nature of species avoidance strategies, spatial overlap coefficients are increasingly being joined with temporal overlap coefficients [e.g. @azzou2021sparse; @farris2020exploring]. However, a threat response may not be routine, but only employed or enhanced when the threat is heightened. Further, overlap coefficients may just reflect different niche preferences. Whether an animal *changes* its activity patterns with an increasing threat level (e.g. higher apex predator activity) is arguably more insightful and relevant to management than arbitrary overlap. Straightforward, integrated methods for examining changes in spatiotemporal animal behaviour are needed.

Generalised additive models (hereafter 'GAMs') are increasingly used to estimate diel activity patterns. GAMs are essentially generalised linear models with added smoothing functions to allow nonlinear relationships between response and numeric explanatory variables [@wood2017generalized]. The daily cycle can be binned into discrete intervals (e.g. hour) and a smooth function of animal activity fitted using a cyclic cubic spline basis - where end points of the spline join (e.g. last and first hour of the day). A maximum wiggliness is specified and complexity penalised (ultimately to a linear function) to avoid overfitting (unlike kernel density estimation). GAMs can incorporate interactions between explanatory variables (both categorical and numerical), however, there are few examples of this being used with diel smooths. This may because these features aren't widely known, or due to sample sizes being too small to fit a separate diel curves across different groups or contexts (e.g individuals, categorical environmental conditions). However, GAMs can be heirarchically specified to share information across categorical groups [@pedersen2019hierarchical]. Hierarchical GAMs estimate an average response, as well as group-level estimates which are penalised as they deviate from the average - providing confidence that these are true deviations across groups. 

Here we provide a case-study to illustrate how generalised additive models can be used to assess spatiotemporal behaviour of two predators. The red fox *Vulpes vulpes* (hereafter 'fox') and feral cat *Felis catus* (hereafter 'cat') have some of the widest distributions of any carnivores, and co-occur across most of their global range. Because of their devastating impacts on native prey in their introduced range, understanding differences in their behavioural ecology across space, and how foxes may impact feral cat behaviour is key to effective management. Numerous studies have investigated interactions between these invasive predators and environmental covariates, but not in a joint spatiotemporal modelling framework. We therefore investigated how predator activity varies across (1) space and (2) vegetation types, as well as (3) how fox spatial activity impacts cat diel behaviour and (4) individual heterogeneity in cats diel activity. We tested this in a simple predator system where only cats and foxes occur, and fox activity is manipulated through lethal control. This allowed sole focus on the interactions between these two predators, across an artificial gradient of apex predator (fox) activity.

## Methods

### Study area
We collated camera-trap data across the Glenelg region and Otway Ranges in south-west Victoria, Australia (Fig. \@ref(fig:diel-map)). The terrestrial mammalian predator guild is depauperate throughout both regions; native dingoes *Canis familiaris* are long absent throughout, tiger quolls *Dasyurus maculatus* are long-absent in the Glenelg region and likely functionally extinct in the Otway Ranges (last confirmed sighting in 2014 despite extensive camera-trapping). Introduced foxes and cats are therefore the only medium-large functional mammalian terrestrial predators across both regions. The purpose of each collated study was to experimentally survey changes in the mammalian community due to fox control. In broad sections of each region, government land managers conduct ongoing targeted fox control for biodiversity conservation. Poison baits containing 3 mg of sodium mono-fluroacetate ('1080') are buried at a depth of 10 cm at 1-km intervals along accessible forest tracks and roads. This allowed us to investigate fox-cat interactions across a gradient of apex predator (fox) activity and other landscape contexts. Prescribed fire is another key management action undertaken throughout both regions (except in very wet sections of Otway Ranges), primarily for asset protection.

In the Glenelg region, Gunditjmara country, natural vegetation--mostly lowland forests and heathy woodlands--is fragmented (Fig. \@ref(fig:diel-map)). Foxes have been subject to lethal control in three distinct forest blocks (separated by pastoral farming and residential property) since October 2005, with 1080 poison-baits replaced fortnightly [@ROBLEY2014262]. Three similar, but unbaited, forest blocks to the north have been surveyed simultaneously as an experimental control [@ROBLEY2014262]. 

The Otway Ranges, Gadubanud country, is a largely continuous patch of natural vegetation with a strong east-west rainfall gradient. A matrix of cool temperate rainforest and wet forest in the high-altitude south-west descends into a large heathland directly north, and into dry forests and then heathlands to the north-east. Foxes are controlled through 1080 poison-baits with monthly replacement across most of the Otway Ranges, but a large section to the north-west remains unbaited. The majority of this baiting began in 2016 - 2017, although fox-baiting commenced in some small sections in 2008.  
 
### Camera-trap surveys
We compiled camera-trap data from three distinct studies across the two regions; totalling 3667 deployments of camera-traps at 1232 camera-trap sites. Camera-traps were active for an average of 47 days, totalling 172,052 trapnights. Camera-trap spacing was variable; the average minimum distance between simultaneously deployed camera-traps was 445, 853 and 1266 metres for each study. Camera-traps were deployed in the Glenelg region between 2013 – 2019, and in the Otway Ranges between 2016 – 2019. 

All camera-trap deployments consisted of a Reconyx (Holmen, Wisconsin) brand camera-trap (both white and infrared flash), attached to a tree or a metal picket, facing a lure. Camera-traps were set-up in two ways depending on the key aim of the project, either targeted toward predators or prey species. One study across both regions positioned camera-traps lower on a tree (around 15 - 30 cm above the ground – angled only slightly downwards) facing a tuna oil lure approximately 2 - 2.5 m away [detailed in @rees2019unexpectedly]. The remaining camera-traps were positioned higher on a tree or a metal picket (at least 40 cm above ground) and angled downwards more strongly - facing a lure approximately 1 - 1.5 m away. These lures consisted of peanut butter, golden syrup and rolled oats mixed into a small ball, placed within a tea strainer or PVC pipe container and secured either to the ground, or 20 - 60 cm above ground on a wooden stake. All set-ups were effective in detecting both predator species.  

### Data preparation
We first created a table of species detections and deployment information (coordinates, dates) for every camera-trap deployment. All data analysis was conducted in R version 3.6.3 [@R]. We used lorelograms to identify the minimum interval to approximate independence [@iannarilli2019lorelograms]; this indicated discarding repeat detections of a species within 30 minutes was sufficient in reducing temporal autocorrelation. To account for day length variation across space and time, we extracted sunrise and sunset times for each camera-trap deployment using the 'maptools' R-package [@maptools] and adjusted detection times to be relative to sunrise and sunset using the average double anchoring approach described by @vazquez2019comparing. Using the 'reshape' R-package [@reshape], we manipulated the detection table into a dataframe with a row for each hour of the day, for every camera-trap deployment, recording the total number of 'independent' fox and feral cat detections within each hour for the entire camera-trap survey duration.  

We attached the Ecological Vegetation Class groups ['EVC'; @delwp2020]) at each camera-trap location. Eight EVC groups types were surveyed in both regions, although to varying degrees (Table 1). In the Otway region, rainforests are finely interspersed (primarily in low lying gullies) throughout wet and damp forests, and so we merged these groups (hereafter 'wet forests'). To account for fox control, we calculated the number of poison fox-baits within a 2.3 km radius around each camera-trap for each deployment - the average maximum distance foxes in these regions travel from their home range centre [@hradsky2017human]. To investigate changes in feral cat diel activity in response to counts of foxes. We added an extra column to our dataframe with the total number of fox detections for each camera-trap deployment, divided by the log of the number of survey days to account for differences in camera-trap survey durations (hereafter 'adjusted fox counts'). 


### Generalised additive models
We modelled the total predator counts for each camera-trap deployment (response variable) with generalised additive mixed-effect models implemented in the 'mgcv' R-package [@wood2017generalized]. We used REML estimation and the negative binomial family (as overdispersion, but not zero-inflation, was detected using the 'DHARMa' R-package @DHARMa). We specified a model offset to account for differences in camera-trap survey duration, and a random intercept for each site to account for repeat sampling. For fox models (n = 2), we included a smooth effect of poison-bait density using a thin plate regression spline basis. This formed the base model specification for each model we fitted. Models differed in their specification of the cyclical hour smooth in order to provide inference on variations of predator diel activity across (1) space (2) EVC groups, as well as for feral cats across the range of observed fox activity (3), and across each identified individual cat (4); detailed in the sections below. This model specification allowed both spatial activity to be higher in each context (i.e. across coordinates, vegetation types, fox activity levels, individual cats) in addition to variable diel activity patterns. We plotted models using 'ggplot2' and 'gratia' R-packages [@ggplot2; @gratia].

#### Spatial variation in predator activity
We fit a model for each predator which included a tensor product interaction between a spatial smooth and hourly smooth. This allowed predators to have different activity levels across space (static across the years surveyed), as well as a variation in diel activity across space. Space was modelled using camera-trap coordinates and a duchon spline basis [@miller2014finite]. To compare relative diel activity pattern strengths - how much activity patterns vary across the daily cycle - we plotted the difference between the minimum and maximum activity estimate for every predicted location. 

#### Variation in predator activity across vegetation types 
We estimated predator diel activity across EVC group using a hierarchical model specification; a global smoother for hour and group-level smoothers with shared wiggliness for the seven EVC groups [i.e. model GS in @pedersen2019hierarchical]. We included a random effect to account for overall differences between the two regions. 

#### Feral cat spatiotemporal avoidance of foxes
Analysis of fox diel activity across EVC groups showed strong similarity between all vegetation groups except wet forests. We hypothesised that cats would temporally avoid foxes by becoming more diurnal in dry vegetation groups where foxes were mostly nocturnal, but not in wet forests where fox activity had little variation across the daily cycle. We therefore modelled fox-induced changes in feral cat diel activity separately for wet and dry vegetation groups. We further split dry vegetation groups by region for replication. We refer to the resulting variable as 'habitat type', which had three levels: (1) wet forests and rainforests in the western Otway Ranges ('wet_otways'), (2) dry EVC groups of the Otway Ranges ('dry_otways') and the Glenelg region ('dry_glenelg'). 

We used a tensor product of hour and adjusted fox counts smooths to model feral cat diel activity across the range of observed fox activity. We specified this with a by variable factor smooth to model separate responses for each habitat type. We modelled adjusted fox counts using a thin plate regression spline with shrinkage to penalise the null space in addition to the range space (i.e. shrinking wiggly terms to linear functions) of the spline basis, meaning fox effects could be entirely removed from the model [while the hourly curves could be shrunk to a flat line due the inbuilt range space penalty; @marra2011practical]. This model specification allows five different scenarios: that there was (1) no effect of hour or foxes on feral cats (2) a static hourly effect only, (3) a spatial response to foxes only, (4) a spatial response to foxes and an unrelated static hourly effect, (5) a spatial response to foxes and a hourly effect which changes across the range of fox counts. We also included a separate spatial smooth (using a duchon spline) to account for the effect of unmodelled environmental covariates (including overall differences in spatial activity between regions) and spatial autocorrelation.

#### Individual variation in feral cat diel activity
One of the collated datasets identified individual cats based on unique pelage patterns across the wet forests of the western Otway Ranges and four forest blocks in the Glenelg region (Chapter \@ref(density)). We used only this dataset to model individual heterogeneity in cat diel activity using a hierarchical model specification. This included a global smoother which estimated the average diel activity for all detected cats (including unidentifiable cats), along with group-level smoothers for each identified individual, with a common wiggliness [i.e. model GS in @pedersen2019hierarchical]. This model structure penalises functions which deviate strongly from the average response; individual with few detections should take the shape of the global response.

## Results

Diel activity strength varied across space for both predators (Fig. \@ref(fig:diel-space)). Foxes concentrated activity during particular times of the day, particularly in the Glenelg region, whereas feral cats had more consistent activity throughout the daily cycle. Both predators had similar spatial patterns in diel activity strength across space in the Glenelg region, but seemingly opposing patterns in the Otway Ranges. For example, fox diel activity strength was lowest in the wet forests of south-west Otway Ranges, where feral cat diel strength was highest, as was their overall level of spatial activity (Fig. \@ref(fig:diel-veg)).

On average, both predators occupied similar times of the day--mostly nocturnal with activity peaks around sunrise and sunset (i.e., crepuscular; Fig. \@ref(fig:diel-veg)i). The main difference was that fox activity peaked after sunset and they were less likely to be active during the day relative to cats. For foxes, little variation in this pattern was shown across all EVC groups except in wet forests--foxes were nearly as active during the day as they were at night in wet forests (Fig. \@ref(fig:diel-veg)a). On the other hand, cats were nocturnal (and most abundant) in wet forests, but largely crepuscular in all other EVC groups (Fig. \@ref(fig:diel-veg)b). Cats tended to be more active at sunset than sunrise. For both predator-vegetation models, the random effect for region (Glenelg or Otways) was shrunk to near-zero effect.  

Across all habitat type replicates, feral cats changed diel patterns changed across the gradient of fox activity (Fig. \@ref(fig:diel-cat-fox)). In the Glenelg region and dry Otway EVC groups, feral cats shifted from nocturnal-crepuscular diel patterns where fox activity was low, to being most active during the day where fox activity was high. In the wet forests of the Otway Ranges, feral cats became more strongly nocturnal with increasing fox activity. Cat spatial activity was relatively unaffected by the fox activity gradient in both habitat types of the Otway Ranges, but increased with the number of fox detections in the Glenelg region (Fig. \@ref(fig:diel-cat-fox)).

There was high individual heterogeneity in cat diel activity patterns in the Glenelg region relative the wet forests of the Otway Ranges (Fig. \@ref(fig:diel-individuals)). In the Glenelg region, the average diel activity pattern was shrunk to an almost flat line; diel activity curves were  estimated nearly separately for each individual (individuals with few detections were heavily penalised towards a flat line). In the western Otway Ranges, feral cats on average were nocturnal; individuals mostly deviated with different activity peaks near sunrise and sunset times or the strength of diel activity (i.e., difference between high and low activity throughout the daily cycle). We had data from 39 individual cats in the Glenelg region and 94 individuals in the western Otway Ranges.  

Overall, we collated 5449 and 2202 'independent' (separated by at least 30 minutes) detections of foxes and cats, respectively (Table \@ref(tab:diel-tab1). The models explained 18.1 - 35.2% of null deviance (n = 7). Cat models with individual variation had relatively poor model fit (based on adjusted r-square values).

## Discussion

Animal diel activity patterns are usually averaged across populations and regions, but here we have demonstrated just how variable diel patterns are across individuals, threat-levels and landscape contexts. Understanding how diel activity varies across different habitats provides important context for exploring threat avoidance responses. We found that foxes were likely a strong driver of feral cat diel activity across three replicates -- able to completely shift cat activity from night to day. Diel activity patterns are complex--GAMs offer a robust, flexible way to model diel activity across different circumstances. 

Foxes tended to strongly concentrate activity during particular times of the day, but this varied substantially across space. In these study regions, Hradsky found half her GPS collared spent the night travelling to farm / townships, and days in the forest. Proximity to forest edge would be worth exploring the future. Strongest fox diel strength variation was seen in the Otways, here it appeared closely tied to vegetation type: heathland (strongest), dry forest (moderate), and wet forest (weakest). This was confirmed by our vegetation analysis. Perhaps this is due to differences in prey availability or  exposure / shelter availability (e.g. eagles, humans) or thermoregulation? However, foxes and cats share a similar niche / lots of prey - and had different activity patterns across veg types - so this is unlikely to be driven purely by environmental constraints. Cats had similar spatial patterns in diel strength to foxes in glenelg, but seemingly opposite in the Otways - perhaps avoidance.

Both predator species had extremely similar diel activity patterns on average, however, subordinate cats shifted activity to less risky times of the day as apex predator (fox) activity increased. We observed these shifts in diel activity with increasing threat levels across our three replicates. Where foxes were largely nocturnal (dry vegetation types) cats increased activity during the day across in the Glenelg and Otway regions. Where foxes were active consistently throughout the daily cycle, cats concentrated activity around midnight (Fig. \@ref(fig:diel-cat-fox)). This likely reflects temporal avoidance, and demonstrates that avoidance can be dynamic across different contexts. Cats are expected to avoid foxes spatially, however, we observed no spatial association between cats and foxes in the Otways, and a positive correlation between the predators in the Glenelg region. Cats and foxes have similar requirements, and so, shifting diel activity patterns perhaps allows spatial coexistence in the Glenelg region. This result demonstrates the importance of modelling changes in predator diel activity, not just overlap, and considering this in a joint spatiotemporal framework. 

One question which arises from this work is whether individuals themselves have flexible diel patterns, or is individual variation due to the unique spatial context of an animals home range? Cats in the Glenelg region had more variation in diel activity than similarity; Otway cats broadly followed an average nocturnal pattern with small deviations. Perhaps this was because individual cats were identified across a large area in the Glenelg region, whereas where we surveyed cats across a much smaller, and more heterogenous in terms of vegetation type. Fox activity was also lowest here (western Otway wet forests), with weak diel activity patterns meaning cats could avoid foxes just as easily at night compared to day, unlike Glenelg. We therefore expect the higher diel activity variation across individuals cats the Glenelg region to reflect the higher variation in habitats and threats from foxes which require more drastic changes. To better test this, a future research priority, would be to model diel activity patterns shifts within individuals (e.g. refs). Although this would require more intensive data. 

We are not aware of other approaches which have used heirachical or spatial models of diel activity. The only other approach we have seen was to model diel activity with continuous covariates is Cunningham. Differences: - quasibinomial, not spatiotemporal. Linear correlation with spatial apex predator abundance - We used a tensor product which included a smooth of apex predator counts because predator interactions may not be linear [@https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2664.2009.01650.x]. This also, allowed us to combine with shrinkage - so this association between the species could be completely removed if the data didn't support such an interaction. Combined spatiotemporal modelling - differences to other approaches. 

Our GAM approaches is simple and flexible. Robust - more aligned with null hypothesis testing - small sample sizes shrink to a flat line (or to the average), in contrast to circular overlap which produces spurious shapes. Small sample sizes are usually a problem. Studies often condense grouping categories without testing. We demonstrate hierarchical model specification to share information - ability to pool all available data - easily adapted to other contexts. Limitation: hour is an explanatory - not response variable. Our purpose was inference, so running multiple models not an issue. But for prediction, it would be nice to have multiple variables impacting hour at the same time. Does not (clearly) separate numerical responses from behavioural, see Borchers SCR paper for a possible avenue for this. 

Without modelling changes in diel activity, we would have, like many others, inferred no impact of foxes on cats. Invasive predators are useful species to test this on, as they are extremely adaptable to different conditions. Predator diel activity patterns strength and individual varied considerably between the two regions - cautioning extrapolation of behavioural patterns for these widespread, generalist predators to other areas. Implications for prey.

## Introduction

Diel activity patterns - the distribution of activity throughout the daily cycle - are an important but overlooked aspect of behavioural ecology [@kronfeld2003partitioning]. Animals must allocate particular times of the day to rest, forage, socialise and reproduce, which are traded-off against threat avoidance (e.g., predation) and deterrence against resource loss [i.e. inter and intraspecific competition; @kronfeld2013animal; @creel2008relationships; @fraser1997costs]. A key question in ecological theory is whether animals are evolutionary hardwired to occupy particular temporal niches, or have circadian rhythms which are responsive to changing environmental conditions and interactions with other species [@daan1981adaptive; @schoener1974compression; @lima1990behavioral]. This is important to understand because constrained diel activity can incur fitness costs to individuals and populations [e.g., @lamb2020ecology].

Predators shape ecosystems through both predation and the fear of predation--regulating the number of individuals and the spatiotemporal behaviour of subordinate species [@ritchie2009predator]. The 'landscape of fear' refers to an animal’s perception of spatial variation in predation risk, which can drive spatiotemporal behaviours [@gaynor2019landscapes]. For example, elk *Cervus elaphus* in Yellowstone National Park use risky, open parts of the landscape when the activity of reintroduced wolves *Canis lupus* is low [@kohl2019prey]. Even when faced with the same predator cues and landscape context, behavioural choices likely vary across individuals due to personality trait differences [@quinn2012personality; @basille2015plastic; @lamb2020ecology; @bonnot2014interindividual]. Populations with high individual heterogeneity in spatiotemporal behaviour may be more adaptable to threats [@wolf2012animal] and resistant to management [@swan2017ecology].

Diel activity patterns are increasingly considered as technology like telemetry devices and camera-traps have become more widely available [@lashley2018estimating]. Telemetry devices provide high resolution data at the individual-level, however, resource constraints generally limit these studies to few individuals and target personalities susceptible to physical capture [@biro2008sampling]. Camera-traps are particularly useful because they provide a more balanced view of the entire population and can detect multiple species, providing inference on ecological differences and species interactions [@harmsen2009spatial]. However, individual-level inference from camera-trap images is limited to species with unique markings. For example, @distiller2020using recently used camera-traps to individually identify jaguars and estimate sex difference in diel activity patterns. Even when information on individual diel activity patterns is available, studies predominantly estimate these patterns at the population-level due to small sample sizes [e.g., @kohl2019prey]. 

A variety of statistical approaches are used to model diel behaviour separately across different categorical contexts, but few allow continuous *changes* in diel activity [@frey2017investigating]. Kernel density estimation is most commonly used and provides a coefficient of overlap between two diel curves [i.e., temporal overlap between two species or one species in two categorical contexts; @ridout2009estimating]. Kernel density estimation does not incorporate explanatory variables and is susceptible to noisy estimates from small sample sizes [@iannarilli2019lorelograms; @frey2017investigating]. To account for the spatiotemporal nature of avoidance behaviours, temporal overlap coefficients are increasingly being joined with spatial overlap coefficients [e.g., @azzou2021sparse; @farris2020exploring]. However, overlap coefficients do not account for behavioural changes which are employed or enhanced under heightened threat-levels [@lima1990behavioral; @guillaume2020co-occurrence]. Straightforward, integrated methods for examining dynamic changes in spatiotemporal animal behaviour are needed.

An increasingly popular method to estimate diel activity patterns are Generalised Additive Models (hereafter 'GAMs'). GAMs have smoothing functions to avoid overfitting and can incorporate interactions between explanatory variables [both categorical and numerical; @wood2017generalized], however, there are few examples of activity curves interacting with continuous covariates [although see @cunningham2019temporal]. This may because these features aren't widely known, or due to concerns that sample sizes are too small to fit separate diel curves to different groups or contexts (e.g individuals or categorical environmental conditions). However, hierarchical GAMs can estimate separate functions while sharing information across categorical groups [@pedersen2019hierarchical]. Hierarchical GAMs estimate an average functional response and group-level functions which are penalised as they deviate from the average - providing confidence that they are true deviations rather than artefacts of noisy data [@pedersen2019hierarchical]. 

Here we illustrate how generalised additive models can be used to jointly assess spatial and temporal animal activity patterns, using two competing invasive predators as a case-study. The red fox *Vulpes vulpes* (hereafter 'fox') and feral cat *Felis catus* (hereafter 'cat') have some of the widest distributions of any carnivores, and co-occur across most of their global range. Because of their devastating impacts on native prey in their introduced range, understanding differences in their behavioural ecology across space, and how foxes may impact feral cat behaviour is key to effective management [@doherty2017stop]. Numerous studies have investigated environmental drivers and interactions between these invasive predators [e.g., @molsher2017mesopredator; @roshier2021space], but not in a joint spatiotemporal framework. We investigated how the diel activity patterns of each predator vary across (1) space and (2) vegetation types, as well as (3) in response to fox spatial activity for cats and (4) among individual cats. We tested this in a simple predator system where only cats and foxes occur, and fox activity is manipulated using lethal control. This allowed sole focus on the interactions between these two predators, across an artificial gradient of apex predator (fox) activity.

## Methods
We collated camera-trap data from three studies across two distinct regions in south-west Victoria, Australia: the Glenelg region and Otway Ranges (Fig. \@ref(fig:diel-map)). Introduced foxes and cats are the only medium-large functional mammalian terrestrial predators across both regions: native dingoes *Canis familiaris* are long absent throughout, tiger quolls *Dasyurus maculatus* are long-absent in the Glenelg region and likely functionally extinct in the Otway Ranges (last confirmed sighting in 2014 despite extensive camera-trapping). In broad sections of each region, government land managers conduct ongoing targeted fox control for biodiversity conservation. Poison baits containing 3 mg of sodium mono-fluroacetate ('1080') are buried at a depth of 10 cm at 1-km intervals along accessible forest tracks and roads.

In the Glenelg region, Gunditjmara country, large patches of natural vegetation--mostly lowland forests and heathy woodlands—are fragmented by pastoral farming and residential properties (Fig. \@ref(fig:diel-map)). Foxes have been subject to lethal control in three distinct forest blocks since October 2005, with 1080 poison-baits replaced fortnightly [@robley2014long]. Three similar, but unbaited, forest blocks to the north are surveyed simultaneously as an experimental control [@robley2020glenelg]. 

The Otway Ranges, Gadubanud and Wadawurrung country, is a largely continuous patch of natural vegetation with a strong east-west rainfall gradient. A matrix of cool temperate rainforest and wet forest at high-altitudes in the south-west descend into a large heathland directly north, and into dry forests and then heathlands to the north-east. Foxes are controlled through 1080 poison-baits with monthly replacement across most of the Otway Ranges, but a large section to the north-west remains unbaited. Fox-baiting commenced in some small sections in 2008 but the majority of baiting began in 2016 - 2017. 
 
### Camera-trap surveys
We compiled camera-trap data from three distinct studies across the two regions; totalling 3667 deployments of camera-traps at 1232 camera-trap sites. The purpose of each study was to quantify changes in the mammalian community due to fox control. Fox control had been occurring in treatment landscapes for 8 - 14 years by the time of these camera-trap surveys; sites in the Otways Ranges were surveyed initially before and up to 3 years following the commencement of fox control. 

All camera-trap deployments consisted of a Reconyx (Holmen, Wisconsin) brand camera-trap (white or infrared flash), attached to a tree or a metal picket, facing a lure. One study across both regions (M.W.R PhD surveys; 949 deployments at 620 unique sites) positioned camera-traps low on a tree (around 15 - 30 cm above the ground – angled only slightly downwards) facing a tuna oil lure approximately 2 - 2.5 m away [detailed in @rees2019unexpectedly]. The others two studies (Glenelg Ark and Otway Ark fox control program annual monitoring; 1616 camera-trap deployments at 240 sites and 1113 deployments from 372 sites, respectively) positioned camera-traps higher on a tree or a metal picket (at least 40 cm above ground) and angled more strongly downwards toward a lure approximately 1 - 1.5 m away [@robley2020glenelg]. These lures consisted of peanut butter, golden syrup and rolled oats mixed into a small ball, placed within a tea strainer or PVC pipe container and secured either to the ground, or 20 - 60 cm above ground on a wooden stake. All set-ups were effective in detecting both predator species. 

Camera-traps were active for an average of 47 days, totalling 172,052 trap-nights. Camera-trap spacing was variable; the average minimum distance between simultaneously deployed camera-traps was 445 m, 853 m and 1266 m, respectively. Camera-traps were deployed in the Glenelg region between 2013 – 2019, and in the Otway Ranges between 2016 – 2019. 

### Data preparation
All data analysis was conducted in R version 3.6.3 [@R]. We first created a table of species detections and deployment information (coordinates, dates) for each camera-trap deployment. We then used lorelograms to identify the minimum interval to approximate independence [@iannarilli2019lorelograms]; this indicated discarding repeat detections of a species within 30 minutes was sufficient to reduce temporal autocorrelation. To account for day length variation across space and time, we extracted sunrise and sunset times for each camera-trap deployment using the 'maptools' R-package [@maptools] and adjusted detection times to be relative to sunrise and sunset using the average double anchoring approach described by @vazquez2019comparing. Using the 'reshape' R-package [@reshape], we manipulated the detection table into a dataframe with a row for each hour of the day, for every camera-trap deployment, recording the total number of 'independent' fox and feral cat detections within each hour for the entire camera-trap survey duration. 

We identified the mapped Ecological Vegetation Class group ['EVC'; @delwp2020] at each camera-trap location. Eight EVC groups types were surveyed in both regions, although to varying degrees (Table 1). In the Otway region, rainforests are finely interspersed (primarily in low lying gullies) throughout wet and damp forests, and so we merged these groups (hereafter 'wet forests'). To account for fox control, we calculated the number of poison fox-baits within a 2.3 km radius around each camera-trap for each deployment; this is the average maximum distance foxes in these regions travel from their home range centre [@hradsky2017human]. To investigate changes in feral cat diel activity in response to counts of foxes, we calculated the total number of fox detections for each camera-trap deployment, divided by the log of the number of survey days to account for differences in camera-trap survey durations (hereafter 'adjusted fox counts'). 

### Generalised additive models
GAMs are essentially generalised linear models with added smoothing functions to allow nonlinear relationships between response and explanatory variables [@wood2017generalized]. The daily cycle of diel activity can be binned into discrete intervals (e.g., hour) and a smooth function of animal activity fitted using a cyclic cubic spline basis where end points of the spline join (e.g., last and first hour of the day). A maximum wiggliness is specified and complexity penalised (ultimately to a linear function) to avoid overfitting.

We modelled the total count of each predator for each camera-trap deployment (response variable) with generalised additive mixed-effect models implemented in the 'mgcv' R-package [@wood2017generalized]. We used the negative binomial family as overdispersion, but not zero-inflation, was detected using the 'DHARMa' R-package [@DHARMa]. We specified a model offset to account for differences in camera-trap survey duration, and a random intercept for each site to account for repeat sampling. For fox models only (n = 2), we included a smooth effect of poison-bait density using a thin plate regression spline basis. This formed the base model specification for each model we fitted; models differed in their specification of the cyclical hour smooth in order to provide inference on variations of predator diel activity across the four questions of interest identified in our aims; detailed in the sections below. We plotted models using 'ggplot2' and 'gratia' R-packages [@ggplot2; @gratia].

#### Spatial variation in predator activity
We fit a model for each predator which included a tensor product interaction between a spatial smooth and hourly smooth. This allowed predators to have different activity levels across space (static across the years surveyed), as well as a variation in diel activity across space. Space was modelled using camera-trap coordinates and a duchon spline basis [@miller2014finite]. To compare how much activity patterns varied across the daily cycle between locations (relative diel activity pattern strengths), we plotted the percentage increase from the minimum to maximum activity estimate for every predicted location.

#### Variation in predator activity across vegetation types 
We estimated predator diel activity across EVC groups using a hierarchical model specification: a global smoother for hour and group-level smoothers with shared wiggliness for the seven EVC groups [i.e. model GS in @pedersen2019hierarchical]. We included a random effect to account for overall differences between the two regions. 

#### Feral cat spatiotemporal avoidance of foxes
Analysis of fox diel activity across EVC groups showed strong similarity between all vegetation groups except wet forests. We hypothesised that cats would temporally avoid foxes by becoming more diurnal in dry vegetation groups where foxes were mostly nocturnal, but not in wet forests where fox activity had little variation across the daily cycle. We therefore modelled fox-induced changes in feral cat diel activity separately for wet and dry vegetation groups. We further split dry vegetation groups by region for replication. We refer to the resulting variable as 'habitat type', which had three levels: (i) wet forests and rainforests in the western Otway Ranges ('wet_otways'), (ii) dry EVC groups of the Otway Ranges ('dry_otways') and (iii) the Glenelg region ('dry_glenelg'). 

We used a tensor product of hour and adjusted fox counts smooths to model feral cat diel activity across the range of observed fox activity. We specified this with a by-variable factor smooth to model separate responses for each habitat type. We modelled adjusted fox counts using a thin plate regression spline with shrinkage to penalise the null space in addition to the range space (i.e. shrinking wiggly terms to linear functions) of the spline basis, meaning fox effects could be entirely removed from the model [while the hourly curves could be shrunk to a flat line due the inbuilt range space penalty; @marra2011practical]. This model specification allowed five different scenarios: that there was (1) no effect of hour or foxes on feral cats (2) a static hourly effect only, (3) a spatial response to foxes only, (4) a spatial response to foxes and an unrelated static hourly effect, or (5) a spatial response to foxes and an hourly effect which changes across the range of fox counts. We also included a separate spatial smooth (using a duchon spline) to account for the effect of unmodelled environmental covariates (including overall differences in spatial activity between regions) and spatial autocorrelation.

#### Individual variation in feral cat diel activity
One of the collated datasets identified individual cats based on unique pelage patterns across the wet forests of the western Otway Ranges and four forest blocks in the Glenelg region (Chapter \@ref(density)). We used this dataset to model individual heterogeneity in cat diel activity using a hierarchical model specification. This included a global smoother which estimated the average diel activity for all detected cats (including unidentifiable cats), along with group-level smoothers for each identified individual, with a common wiggliness [i.e. model GS in @pedersen2019hierarchical]. This model structure penalises functions which deviate strongly from the average response; individual with few detections should take the shape of the global response.

## Results
Overall, we collated 5449 and 2202 'independent' (separated by at least 30 minutes) detections of foxes and cats, respectively (Table \@ref(tab:diel-tab1). The models explained 18.1 - 35.2% of null deviance (n = 7) (**Or spell out for each model is the corresponding section below?**). 

#### Spatial variation in predator activity
Diel activity strength varied across space for both predators (Fig. \@ref(fig:diel-space)). Fox activity was concentrated strongly at particular times of the day, especially in the Glenelg region where activity varied by up to 371% throughout the daily cycle. Feral cats had relatively more consistent activity throughout the daily cycle and across regions; the maximum difference in cat activity throughout the daily cycle for any given location was 185%. Both predators had similar spatial patterns in diel activity strength across space in the Glenelg region, but seemingly opposing patterns in the Otway Ranges. For example, fox diel activity strength was lowest in the wet forests of south-west Otway Ranges, where feral cat diel strength was highest (Fig. \@ref(fig:diel-space)).

#### Variation in predator activity across vegetation types 
On average, both predators occupied similar times of the day--mostly nocturnal with activity peaks around sunrise and sunset (i.e., crepuscular; Fig. \@ref(fig:diel-veg)i). The main difference was that fox activity peaked after sunset and they were less likely to be active during the day relative to cats. For foxes, little variation in this pattern was shown across all EVC groups except wet forests, where foxes were nearly as active during the day as they were at night (Fig. \@ref(fig:diel-veg)a). On the other hand, cats were nocturnal (and most abundant) in wet forests, but largely crepuscular in all other EVC groups (Fig. \@ref(fig:diel-veg)b). Cats tended to be more active at sunset than sunrise. For both predators, the random effect for region (Glenelg or Otways) in the vegetation models shrank to near-zero effect, indicating all variation between the regions was explained by the vegetation covariate and site random intercept. Fox activity similar across EVC groups, except was lower in wet forests. Relative to foxes, cat activity was more variable across EVC groups; lowest in heathy woodlands and highest in wet forests (Fig. \@ref(fig:diel-veg)b). 

#### Feral cat spatiotemporal avoidance of foxes
Across all habitat type replicates, feral cats diel patterns changed across the gradient of fox activity (Fig. \@ref(fig:diel-cat-fox)). In the Glenelg region and dry Otway habitat types, feral cats had a nocturnal-crepuscular diel patterns where fox activity was low, but were most active during the day where fox activity was high. In contrast, in the wet forests of the Otway Ranges, feral cats were more strongly nocturnal when fox activity was high. Cat spatial activity was relatively unaffected by the fox activity gradient in both habitat types of the Otway Ranges, but increased with the number of fox detections in the Glenelg region (Fig. \@ref(fig:diel-cat-fox)), indicating cats did not avoid foxes spatially. 

#### Individual variation in feral cat diel activity
We had data from 39 individual cats in the Glenelg region and 94 individuals in the western Otway Ranges. Individual heterogeneity in cat diel activity patterns was higher in the Glenelg region than the Otway Ranges (Fig. \@ref(fig:diel-individuals)). In the Glenelg region, the average diel activity pattern was shrunk to an almost flat line; diel activity curves were estimated nearly separately for each individual (although individuals with few detections were heavily penalised towards a flat line). In the western Otway Ranges, feral cats on average were nocturnal; individuals mostly deviated with different activity peaks near sunrise and sunset times or the strength of diel activity (i.e., difference between high and low activity throughout the daily cycle).

## Discussion

Animal diel activity patterns can be complex; varying across individuals, habitat types and threat-levels. Despite telling an important story about how animals interact with each other and the environment, detection times are commonly discarded from statistical analyses. But even when considered, circadian rhythms are predominantly modelled at the population-level, overlooking behavioural syndromes which can affect fitness, survival and ecosystem-impacts. In our study, sympatric invasive predators had similar diel activity patterns when averaged across broad regions [i.e., high circular overlap; @roshier2021space], but behaviours varied considerably within landscapes, as revealed by our joint spatiotemporal modelling framework. Fox activity was strongly tied to the daily cycle, but differed across dry (nocturnal behaviour) and wet (cathemeral behaviour) vegetation communities. At sites with high fox activity, subordinate feral cats shifted activity to less risky times-of-the-day, likely facilitating spatial coexistence [@carothers1984time]. Considering changes in animal activity throughout the daily cycle provides important context for understanding species interactions, which is key for effective ecosystem management [@gaynor2021applied]. 

In our study, simply comparing average diel activity overlap between two species [@ridout2009estimating] would have been misleading for two reasons. Firstly, apex predator temporal avoidance strategies were not consistently employed, but dependent on encounter risk. Secondly, temporal avoidance was dynamic, depending on the spatially variable diel patterns of the apex predator. Few studies have demonstrated predator-induced shifts in diel activity such as these [@kronfeld2003partitioning], but notably, ship rats *Rattus norvegicus* were also found to switch from nocturnal to diurnal behaviour in response to fox activity [@fenn1995use]. In the wet forests of the Otway Ranges, cats exposed to high fox activity levels concentrated their activity away from sunset and sunrise towards midnight, despite a diurnal shift appearing to similarly reduce the risk of a fox encounter. We expect becoming more nocturnal to be favourable over a diurnal shift because this is when prey are most active here and cats would be least visible [as most cats here had black or dark coloured coats; @graipel2014role]. 

Shifting diel activity patterns may allow the spatial coexistence of dominant and subordinate species [@kronfeld2003partitioning; @carothers1984time]. Cats and foxes have similar requirements [@stobo2021reptiles; @stobo2021sharing; @glen2005complex], and so, altering preferred circadian rhythms may be worthwhile to persist in high-quality habitat. We observed no spatial association between cats and foxes in the Otways, and a slightly positive correlation between the predators in the Glenelg region (Fig. \@ref(fig:diel-cat-fox)). Without jointly modelling changes in diel activity, we would have inferred no impact of apex predators on feral cats, like others previously have [e.g., @fancourt2019introduced; @stobo2020habitat]. Understanding behavioural change impacts on native prey is a key future research priority to improve invasive predator management.

Individual cats in the Glenelg region had more variation than similarity in diel activity patterns, whereas cats in the wet forests of the Otway Ranges were mostly nocturnal, with relatively slight deviations across individuals. This result is unsurprising for two reasons. Firstly, cats were identified to the individual-level across a larger area with more heterogeneous vegetation types in the Glenelg region. Secondly, more drastic changes in diel activity were attributable to the threat of foxes in the Glenelg region relative the wet forests of the Otway Ranges. One question arising from this is whether individuals themselves have dynamic diel patterns (or spatial patterns for that matter), or whether individual variation is due to the unique spatial context of an animals home range. Estimating diel activity separately for individual animals facilitates identification of common behavioural syndromes, which is particularly useful when individual demographics (e.g., age, sex) are unknown. 

Generalised additive models provide a flexible joint approach to modelling spatiotemporal activity. Previous spatiotemporal studies of predator avoidance have largely relied on repeating analyses (name resource selection functions) at different periods of the daily cycle [e.g., @smith2019integrating; @basille2015plastic; @kohl2019prey]. Here we demonstrate how GAMs can model continuous shifts in activity across both space and time, with complex variable interactions and information sharing. Smoothing penalties make GAMs more closely aligned with null hypothesis testing; the null hypothesis being that there are no diel patterns in activity and, for hierarchical specifications, different groups all follow the same average diel pattern. This makes diel GAMs more robust than separately fit models for categorical time periods and kernel density estimation, in which noisy data can produce spurious estimates [@iannarilli2019lorelograms]. Despite the added complexity, GAMs in the 'mgcv' R-package are straightforward to fit. For individually identifiable species, the @distiller2020using spatial capture-recapture model offers an extremely powerful extension of GAMs to disentangle behavioural and numerical population effects, although at considerable computational costs and data requirements. 

Our study adds to the limited body of evidence that top predators can produce a landscape of fear which is powerful enough to reverse the circadian rhythms of subordinate species [@kronfeld2003partitioning]. A key distinction of our study is that we modelled avoidance behaviours in a simple predator guild, where apex predator activity was artificially manipulated, reducing bias from differences in niche preferences or the unmodelled impacts of other predators in the system. We also included replication across different habitat types, revealing flexible predator behaviour and dynamic species interactions. Our results demonstrate the importance of (a) considering diel activity in regards to species interactions, (b) modelling *changes* in animal behaviour rather than overlap with other species, and (c) testing avoidance behaviours within a joint spatiotemporal framework. Our GAM framework for modelling spatiotemporal activity can be used on any species with time-stamped detections, covariates and hierarchical groupings.

# Spatial variation in predator diel patterns -- feral cats avoid red foxes in time, not space. {#diel}

## Abstract {-}

Understanding the constraints apex predators impose on subordinate species is important for anticipating outcomes of predator management. Predator behaviour may vary across heterogeneous landscapes, and subordinate predators may avoid dominant predators in time or space, making it difficult to quantify relaxation or strengthening of antipredator behaviours.

In this study, we tested whether the lethal control of an introduced apex predator (red fox *Vulpes vulpes*) led to a mesopredator release--in terms of spatiotemporal behaviour--of an introduced mesopredator (feral cat *Felis catus*). We surveyed invasive predators using 3667 camera-trap deployments across two regions of south-eastern Australia with simplified predator guilds, where foxes were poison-baited in some landscapes. This allowed sharp focus on the interactions between these species across experimental gradients of apex predator activity and a range of habitat types. We modelled variation in predator spatiotemporal activity throughout the daily cycle using generalised additive models, including interactions with categorical (vegetation type) and continuous (geographic coordinates, apex predator counts) covariates

When averaged across the study region, red foxes and feral cats had very similar diel activity patterns, however, joint spatiotemporal models revealed key nuance at a finer scale. Predator activity varied considerably across the regions, most notably between the dry vegetation communities and wet forests. When we estimated changes in cat behaviour across the range of observed fox counts within the dry habitats (separately across two regions for replication) and wet forests (one region), we observed patterns consistent with top-down suppression across the three replicates. When fox activity was high, feral cats did not become less active, but shifted diel patterns to less risky times of the day. In dry habitats of both regions, cats shifted from crepuscular-nocturnal to mostly diurnal behavioural. In wet forests, cats became less active at dawn when fox activity was high--fox activity was lowest and relatively consistent throughout the day in wet forests. These changes in diel behaviour may facilitate spatial coexistence between these two invasive predators, potentially shifting impacts onto different native prey species. 

Our results highlight that avoidance behaviours are dynamic across landscapes of fear, which is overlooked when simply comparing the average activity overlap between two species. It is well-appreciated that predator activity varies across space and throughout the daily cycle, however, our study demonstrates that diel patterns also vary across space, mediated by both landscape context and fear.

## Introduction

Predators shape ecosystems through both predation and the fear of predation [@ritchie2009predator]. Fear-induced behavioural suppression could be as detrimental to populations of subordinate species than predation itself [@schmitz2004trophic; @preisser2005scared]. Non-consumptive apex predator effects are expected to be strong drivers of mesopredator behaviour, particularly when resource competition is high [@ritchie2009predator]. Strengthening or relaxing antipredator behaviours can have cascading effects across the entire ecosystem [@estes2011trophic]: altering ecological functions and human-wildlife coexistence [@lamb2020ecology; @nickel2021energetics; @allen2014trophic]. Understanding how top predators constrain the behaviour of subordinate species is important in accurately predicting the ecosystem-wide consequences of predator management, such as reintroductions and lethal control.

Spatial and/or temporal niche partitioning may allow predators to coexist by reducing both encounter-rates and resource overlap [@kronfeld2003partitioning]. However, antipredator behaviours may not be constantly employed because predation risk is variable (throughout the daily cycle and across habitat types) and predator avoidance costly (limiting or relegating activity to suboptimal places / times) [@kauffman2007landscape; @ellner2001habitat; @cunningham2019temporal; @sih2000new; @berger2001recolonizing]. Proactive avoidance of predators is traded-off against resource acquisition, and so the trade-off likely needs rebalancing across heterogeneous landscapes where resource availability (including shelter) and predation risks differ. In different landscape-contexts, temporal predator avoidance may be preferable over spatial avoidance (e.g., when food is constantly available throughout the day) and vice-versa. We generally have a solid understanding of how predators vary across space (due to the proliferation of occupancy and resource selection studies), but often assume predators to consistent diel patterns across broad regions (partly due to a lack of joint spatiotemporal modelling frameworks). To accurately model predator-predator avoidance, we therefore need a prior understanding of how predator behaviour varies across landscapes, as well as to allow avoidance to occur across both space and time. 

There are few statistical approaches which consider animal activity in a joint spatiotemporal framework (temporal in regard to the daily cycle). Instead, responses to 'landscapes of fear' - spatial variation in perceived risk [@gaynor2019landscapes; @laundre2001wolves] are usually modelled in an ad-hoc fashion: separate models for spatial and temporal avoidance, or by repeating spatial analyses (e.g., resource selection functions) at different time periods [e.g., @smith2019integrating; @basille2015plastic; @kohl2019prey]. However, discretising the daily cycle into categorical periods (mostly day and night) introduces bias, assuming animals have complete step-changes in behaviour rather than progressive shifts across the daily cycle (the interface between night-day is also a particularly important time for many species). Generalised Additive Models (hereafter 'GAMs') are increasingly being used to estimate animal diel activity patterns with cyclical splines - matching up late night to early morning [@bischof2014being]. There are many other benefits to GAMs, including smoothing penalties to reduce overfitting, nonlinear interactions of multiple variables with different units ('tensor products') and hierarchical specifications to share information across categorical groups [@wood2017generalized; @pedersen2019hierarchical]. However, we are only aware of one study which allowed animal diel activity to interact with predation risk as a continuous variable [although without considering spatial activity; @cunningham2019temporal]. 

The red fox *Vulpes vulpes* (hereafter 'fox'; ~6 kg) and feral cat *Felis catus* (hereafter 'cat'; ~4 kg) have devastating impacts on native prey throughout their introduced range, implicated in the extinction of **9-11** and 63 species, respectively [@doherty2016invasive]. Cats are more difficult to manage, and so, foxes alone are often targeted in predator control campaigns [namely through poison-baiting; @reddiex2007control]. As foxes and cats compete for many of the same resources, there is concern that lethal fox control could cause a mesopredator [@soule1988reconstructed] or competitor [@ruscoe2011unexpected] release of feral cats [@glen2005complex; @doherty2017stop; @wayne2017recoveries; @marlow2015cats; @comer2020integrating; @robley2014long]. There is some evidence that feral cats increase in activity [although highly uncertain; @hunter2018not], density (Chapter \@ref(occ)). as well as altered their diets and use of space [Chapter \@ref(occ); @molsher2017mesopredator] in response to fox control. Other studies have investigated potential spatial and temporal interactions between these invasive predators [e.g., @roshier2021space], but not in response to fox control, or in a joint spatiotemporal framework, or where cat avoidance behaviours are allowed flexibility in respect to differences in fox activity.

In this study, we explore how the spatiotemporal behaviour of two competing invasive predators varies across heterogeneous landscapes, in response to (1) geographical coordinates and (2) vegetation types. We then investigated (3) whether cats change behaviour in response to the activity of the dominant fox. We tested this in a simple predator system where only cats and foxes occur, and fox activity is manipulated using lethal control in some landscapes. This allowed sole focus on the interactions between these two predators, across an experimental gradient of apex predator (fox) activity. We illustrate how GAMs can provide a simple framework to jointly assess spatial and temporal animal activity patterns, as well as avoidance behaviours.

## Methods
### Study area and camera-trapping 
In this study we compiled data from multiple smaller scale camera-trap studies across two regions in south-west Victoria, Australia: the Glenelg region and Otway Ranges (Fig. \@ref(fig:diel-map)). Introduced foxes and cats are the only medium-large functional mammalian terrestrial predators here: native dingoes *Canis familiaris* are long-absent throughout, while tiger quolls *Dasyurus maculatus* are long-absent in the Glenelg region and likely functionally extinct in the Otway Ranges (last confirmed sighting in 2014). In broad sections of each region, government land managers conduct ongoing targeted lethal fox control for biodiversity conservation. Poison-baits containing 3 mg of sodium mono-fluroacetate ('1080') are buried at a depth of 12 - 15 cm at 1-km intervals along accessible forest tracks and roads. Different road densities result in spatially variable poison-bait densities. Managers also frequently implement prescribed fire across both regions, primarily to reduce fuel loads. 

#### Glenelg region
In the Glenelg region, Gunditjmara country, large patches of natural vegetation are fragmented by pastoral farming and residential properties (Fig. \@ref(fig:diel-map)). Foxes in this region have been subject to poison-baiting in three distinct forest blocks since October 2005, with fortnightly bait replacements [@robley2014long]. These forest blocks, along with three similar, unbaited forest blocks to the north are simultaneously surveyed annually under the 'Glenelg Ark' fox control program [40 camera-sites per block; @robley2020glenelg]. We also included a further 425 camera-trap deployments from early 2018 (M.W.R., PhD surveys). This totals 2039 camera-trap deployments in the Glenelg region, collected in a control-impact experimental design (foxes had been continuously controlled for at 8 - 13 years in the treatment landscapes by the time of these surveys). 

#### Otway Ranges
The Otway Ranges, Eastern Maar country, is a largely continuous patch of natural vegetation with a strong east-west rainfall gradient (Fig. \@ref(fig:diel-map)). A matrix of cool temperate rainforest and wet forest at high-altitudes in the south-west descend into a large heathland directly north, and into dry forests and then heathlands to the north-east.  Fox-baiting commenced in small sections of the Otway Ranges in 2008 and large-scale systematic baiting began in 2016 - 2017 under the 'Otway Ark' program [@robley2019otway]. For the first six weeks, poison-baits were replaced weekly, then changing to ongoing monthly bait-replacement. There was a pause in bait replacement for approximately six months during the second half of 2018. Fox control recommenced with four weeks of fortnightly bait-replacement, before returning to monthly bait-replacement. A large section of the Otway Ranges to the north-west remains unbaited, but is monitored as an experimental non-treatment site [@robley2019otway]. Otway Ark managers survey 372 camera-trap sites annually (sequentially across the region); we present one 'before' baiting survey and two 'after' baiting surveys of each site from 2016 - 2018, totalling 1113 camera-trap deployments [@robley2019otway]. We also include data from an additional before-after control-impact survey (one 'before' baiting survey and two 'after' bating surveys) in the western section of the Otway Ranges, conducted annually 2017 - 2019 (M.W.R PhD surveys). This added a further 195 sites and 524 camera-trap deployments. 

#### Camera-trap set-ups
All camera-trap deployments consisted of a Reconyx (Holmen, Wisconsin) brand camera-trap (white or infrared flash), attached to a tree or a metal picket, facing a lure. The Glenelg Ark and Otway Ark fox monitoring programs positioned camera-traps higher on a tree or a metal picket (at least 40 cm above ground) and angled more strongly downwards toward a lure approximately 1 - 1.5 m away [@robley2020glenelg; @robley2019otway]. These lures consisted of peanut butter, golden syrup and rolled oats mixed into a small ball, placed within a tea strainer or PVC pipe container and secured either to the ground, or 20 - 60 cm above ground on a wooden stake. The M.W.R. PhD surveys across both regions positioned camera-traps lower on a tree (around 15 - 30 cm above the ground – angled only slightly downwards) facing a tuna oil lure approximately 2 - 2.5 m away [detailed in @rees2019unexpectedly]. Camera-traps were active for an average of 47 days (maximum 93 days), totalling 172,052 trap-nights.

### Data preparation
All data analysis was conducted in R version 3.6.3 [@R]. We first used lorelograms to identify the minimum interval to approximate independence [@iannarilli2019lorelograms]; this indicated discarding repeat detections of a species within 30 minutes was sufficient to reduce temporal autocorrelation. To account for day length variation across space and time, we extracted sunrise and sunset times for each camera-trap deployment using the 'maptools' R-package [@maptools] and adjusted detection times to be relative to sunrise and sunset using the average double anchoring approach described by @vazquez2019comparing. We then built a dataframe consisting of a row for each hour of the day, for every camera-trap deployment, recording the total number of 'independent' fox and feral cat detections within each hour for the entire camera-trap survey duration. 

### Generalised additive models
We modelled the total count of each predator for each camera-trap deployment (response variable) with generalised additive mixed-effect models implemented in the 'mgcv' R-package [@wood2017generalized]. We used the negative binomial family as overdispersion, but not zero-inflation, was detected with a poisson distribution using the 'DHARMa' R-package [@DHARMa]. We specified a model offset to account for differences in camera-trap survey duration, and a random intercept for each site to account for repeat sampling. For fox models, we also included a smooth effect of poison-bait density using a thin plate regression spline basis (Chapter \@ref(occ)). This formed the base model specification for each model we fitted; models differed in their specification of the cyclical hour smooth in order to provide inference on variations of predator diel activity across the four questions of interest; detailed in the sections below. 

#### How does predator activity vary across space?
We fit a model for each predator which included a tensor product interaction between a spatial smooth and hourly smooth. This allowed predators to have different activity levels across space (static across the years surveyed), as well as a variation in diel activity across space. Space was modelled using camera-trap coordinates and a duchon spline basis [@miller2014finite]. We were also interested in how the relative strength of diel patterns changed across space, and so we plotted the percentage increase from the minimum to maximum activity estimate within the daily cycle for every predicted location.

#### How does predator activity vary across vegetation types?
We observed differences in predator activity across space and hypothesised that this partly due to the different vegetation types. We therefore identified the Ecological Vegetation Class group [hereafter 'vegetation type'; standard units for vegetation classification in Victoria; @delwp2020bioregions] for each unique camera-trap site, totalling eight vegetation types. As rainforests are interspersed (primarily in low lying gullies) at fine-scales throughout wet and damp forests in the south-eastern Otway Ranges, we merged them together (hereafter referred to as 'wet forests'). We estimated predator diel activity across EVC groups using a hierarchical model specification: a global smoother for hour (i.e., average response) and group-level smoothers with shared wiggliness for the seven vegetation types ['model GS' detailed in @pedersen2019hierarchical]. We also included a random effect to account for overall differences in activity levels between the two regions. 

#### Do feral cat avoid foxes in space or time?
Analysis of fox diel activity across EVC groups showed strong similarity between all vegetation types except wet forests. We hypothesised that cats would temporally avoid foxes by becoming more diurnal in dry vegetation types where foxes were mostly nocturnal, but not in wet forests where fox activity had little variation across the daily cycle. We therefore modelled fox-induced changes in feral cat diel activity separately for wet forest and dry vegetation types. We further split dry vegetation types by region for replication. We refer to the resulting variable as 'habitat type', which had three levels: (i) wet forests and rainforests in the western Otway Ranges ('wet_otways'), (ii) dry EVC groups of the Otway Ranges ('dry_otways') and (iii) the Glenelg region ('dry_glenelg'). 

To investigate changes in feral cat diel activity across the range of observed fox activity, we calculated the total number of fox detections for each camera-trap deployment, divided by the log of the number of survey days to account for differences in camera-trap survey durations (hereafter 'adjusted fox counts'). We used a tensor product interaction of hour (cyclical spine) and adjusted fox counts (thin plate regression spline with shrinkage - meaning fox effects could be entirely removed from the model if not supported by sufficient data), allowing cats to have non-linear responses to both hour and adjusted fox counts. We fit separate tensor product interactions for each habitat type (using a 'by-variable' term). For a direct visual comparison to fox activity, we fit another fox model where a diel curve was estimated separately across each of the three habitat types.

## Results
Overall, we collated 5449 and 2202 detections of foxes and cats, respectively (separated by at least 30 minutes; Table \@ref(tab:diel-tab1)). 

#### How does predator activity vary across space?
Predator activity varied considerably across space, but there were also deviations from the average diel patterns across space. Variation across space, as well as differences in activity patterns between the predators was strongest in the Otway Ranges. For example, fox activity (Fig. \@ref(fig:diel-space-o-fox)) and diel strength (i.e., difference between the lowest and highest activity estimate across the daily cycle for each location; Fig. \@ref(fig:diel-space)b) was lowest in the south-west Otway Ranges, where feral cat activity (Fig. \@ref(fig:diel-space-o-cat)) and diel strength (Fig. \@ref(fig:diel-space)b) was highest. Both predators had relatively similar spatial patterns in diel activity strength across space in the Glenelg region (Fig. \@ref(fig:diel-space)a; Fig. \@ref(fig:diel-space-fox-eg); (Fig. \@ref(fig:diel-space-g-cat)). Fox activity was concentrated strongly at particular times of the day, especially in the Glenelg region where activity varied by up to 371% throughout the daily cycle (Fig. \@ref(fig:diel-space)a). Feral cats had relatively more consistent activity throughout the daily cycle and across regions; the maximum difference in cat activity throughout the daily cycle for any given location was 185%.

#### How does predator activity vary across vegetation types?
On average, both predators occupied similar times of the day--mostly nocturnal with activity peaks around sunrise and sunset (i.e., crepuscular; Fig. \@ref(fig:diel-veg)i). The main difference was that fox activity peaked after sunset and they were less likely to be active during the day relative to cats. For foxes, little variation in this pattern was shown across all EVC groups except wet forests, where foxes were consistently active throughout the daily cycle (Fig. \@ref(fig:diel-veg)a). On the other hand, cats were nocturnal (and most active) in wet forests, but largely crepuscular in all other EVC groups (Fig. \@ref(fig:diel-veg)b). Cats tended to be more active at sunset than sunrise. For both predators, the random effect for region (Glenelg or Otways) in the vegetation models shrank to near-zero effect, indicating all variation between the regions was explained by the vegetation covariate and site random intercept. Ignoring diel patterns, fox activity was similar across EVC groups, but was considerably lower in wet forests. Relative to foxes, cat activity (ignoring diel patterns) was more variable across EVC groups; lowest in heathy woodlands and highest in wet forests (Fig. \@ref(fig:diel-veg)b). 

#### Do feral cat avoid foxes in space or time?
Across all habitat type replicates, feral cats diel patterns changed across the gradient of fox activity (Fig. \@ref(fig:diel-cat-fox)). In the Glenelg region and Otway dry habitat types, feral cats had a nocturnal-crepuscular diel patterns where fox activity was low, but were most active during the day where fox activity was high. In contrast, in the wet forests of the Otway Ranges, feral cats were more strongly nocturnal when fox activity was high. Cat spatial activity was relatively unaffected by the fox activity in both habitat types of the Otway Ranges, if anything increased with increasing number of fox detections in the Glenelg region (Fig. \@ref(fig:diel-cat-fox)), indicating cats did not avoid foxes spatially.

## Discussion
A key question in ecological theory is whether animals are evolutionary hardwired to occupy particular temporal niches, or have circadian rhythms which are responsive to changing environmental conditions and interactions with other species [@daan1981adaptive; @schoener1974compression; @lima1990behavioral]. Here we demonstrate that diel patterns are not fixed, but vary across space based on landscape context and fear. In our study, sympatric invasive predators had similar diel activity patterns when averaged across broad regions [i.e., high circular overlap; as did @roshier2021space], but behaviours varied considerably within landscapes. Fox activity was most strongly tied to the daily cycle (relative to cats) in dry habitat types, but foxes had little-no diel pattern in the wet forests. At sites with high fox activity, subordinate feral cats shifted activity to less risky times-of-the-day in each of these habitat types, likely facilitating spatial coexistence [@carothers1984time]. Considering changes in animal activity throughout the daily cycle provides important context for understanding species interactions, which is key for effective ecosystem management [@gaynor2021applied].  

In our study, simply comparing average diel activity overlap between two species [@ridout2009estimating] would have been misleading for two reasons. Firstly, apex predator temporal avoidance strategies were not consistently employed, but dependent on encounter risk. Secondly, temporal avoidance was dynamic, depending on the spatially variable diel patterns of the apex predator. Flexible antipredator behaviours make evolutionary sense, but have been rarely tested or shown [although see; **...**; @cunningham2019temporal], because this often requires manipulative experiments or at least more complicated models [@kronfeld2003partitioning]. Generalised additive models provide a flexible joint approach to modelling spatiotemporal activity and here we demonstrate how GAMs can model continuous shifts in activity across both space and time, with complex variable interactions and information sharing. The inbuilt smoothing penalties are another benefit of GAMs over kernel density estimation [@ridout2009estimating], in which noisy data can produce spurious estimates [@iannarilli2019lorelograms; @frey2017investigating]. Despite their complexity, GAMs in the 'mgcv' R-package are straightforward to fit. 

Shifting diel activity patterns may allow the spatial coexistence of dominant and subordinate species [@kronfeld2003partitioning; @carothers1984time]. Cats and foxes have similar requirements [@stobo2021reptiles; @stobo2021sharing; @glen2005complex], and so, altering preferred circadian rhythms may be worthwhile to persist in high-quality habitat. Few studies have demonstrated predator-induced shifts in diel activity such as these [@kronfeld2003partitioning], but notably, ship rats *Rattus norvegicus* were also found to switch from nocturnal to diurnal behaviour in response to fox activity [@fenn1995use]. In the wet forests of the Otway Ranges, cats exposed to high fox activity levels concentrated their activity away from sunrise (mainly) and sunset towards midnight, despite a diurnal shift appearing to similarly reduce the risk of a fox encounter. In this situation, we expect becoming more nocturnal to be favourable over a diurnal shift because this is when the likely preferred prey source (small mammals) are active and cats would be least visible to foxes [as cats here mostly had black or grey coats; @graipel2014role]. Understanding behavioural change impacts on native prey is a key future research priority to improve invasive predator management.

We observed no spatial association between cats and foxes in the Otways within each habitat type, and a slightly positive correlation between the predators in the Glenelg region (Fig. \@ref(fig:diel-cat-fox)). There were some signs of differences in predator spatial activity at broader scales, particularly in the wet forests (fox low, cat high) and dry habitats (fox high, cat low), however, this was more likely to reflect differences in predator densities or niche preferences. A lack of spatial avoidance at fine-scales (i.e, at the camera-trap sites) may be due to these predators sharing many of the same prey species, or could be an artefact of detectability. The 3667 camera-traps were deployed by a range of people with the quality of set-ups in terms of detecting predators differing considerably. Camera-traps which were effective at detecting foxes were likely also effective at detecting cats, particularly those angled only slightly downwards, rather than upwards or strongly downwards (M.W Rees, personal observation). Our camera-traps were also deployed for an average of 47 days, spatial avoidance may occur over much finer time spaces (**refs**), particularly given foxes mark their territory using scats and scents which cats could tangibly associate with high risk in the days following. Without jointly considering changes in diel activity, we would have inferred no impact of apex predators on feral cats, like others previously have [e.g., @fancourt2019introduced; @stobo2020habitat]. 

Animal diel activity patterns can be complex; varying across space, habitat types and threat-levels. Despite telling an important story about how animals interact with each other and the environment, detection times are commonly discarded from statistical analyses. But even when considered, circadian rhythms are predominantly modelled at the population-level, overlooking behavioural syndromes which can affect fitness, survival and ecosystem-impacts. Our study adds to the limited body of evidence that top predators can produce a landscape of fear which is powerful enough to reverse the circadian rhythms of subordinate species [@kronfeld2003partitioning]. A key distinction of our study is that we modelled avoidance behaviours in a simple predator guild, where apex predator activity was artificially manipulated, reducing bias from differences in niche preferences or the unmodelled impacts of other predators in the system. We also included replication across different habitat types, revealing flexible predator behaviour and dynamic species interactions. Our results demonstrate the importance of (a) considering diel activity in regards to species interactions, (b) modelling *changes* in animal behaviour rather than overlap with other species, and (c) testing avoidance behaviours within a joint spatiotemporal framework. Our GAM framework for modelling spatiotemporal activity can be used on any species with time-stamped detections, covariates and hierarchical groupings.

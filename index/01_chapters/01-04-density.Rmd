# Mesopredator release among invasive predators: controlling red foxes can increase feral cat density and alter their behaviour {#density}

## Abstract {-}

The mesopredator release theory predicts that subordinate predator density will increase as dominant predators decline. Persistent debate around mesopredator release in part reflects the lack of robust, replicated experiments to test this theory, and the use of population indices which confound changes in mesopredator density and detectability. This uncertainty has immediate impacts for conservationists who are faced with managing sympatric invasive predators. 
  
We used replicated experimental designs and spatially-explicit models to examine whether mesopredator release of the feral cat *Felis catus* occurs in response to targeted control of the introduced red fox *Vulpes vulpes*. We surveyed three Control-Impact paired landscapes in a region with long-term fox control (1080 poison baiting), and conducted a Before-After Control-Impact Paired-Series experiment in another region. We identified 160 individual feral cats from 68,504 camera-trap nights across twelve surveys in eight landscapes to estimate feral cat density with spatial mark-resight models. 
  
At a landscape scale (mean size: 169 km^2^), lethal fox control was associated with responses ranging from negligible to a 3.7-fold higher density of feral cats. In line with mesopredator release, these differences in cat density correlated with variation in the duration and intensity of fox suppression. At a fine spatial scale (200 m), feral cat density had a negative association with fox occurrence probability across both regions, although uncertainty was high in the region where fox control had only recently commenced. 
  
Feral cat detectability also varied across the (artificially manipulated) fox occurrence probability gradients. In one region, nonlinear models indicated that feral cats exhibited potential avoidance behaviours (lower detection and increased movement rates) when foxes were rare, giving way to density suppression at high fox occurrence probabilities. 
  
Our study provides replicated, experimental evidence that dominant predator suppression tends to be associated with a higher mesopredator density. Mesopredator release can manifest as changes in both behaviour and density, distorting inference if these processes are not distinguished. Our results may help explain why fox control does not consistently improve native prey persistence, suggesting integrated pest management may be necessary to improve conservation outcomes.

## Introduction

Understanding species interactions is critical for effective invasive species management [@zavaleta2001viewing]. When several invasive species co-occur, management actions that suppress the dominant invasive species may inadvertently benefit subordinate invasive species [@jackson2015interactions; @kuebbing2015negative]. For example, the removal of a dominant invasive predator species may increase the density of a subordinate invasive predator species directly by reducing top-down pressure, or indirectly by increasing the availability of shared resources; often referred to as mesopredator or competitor release [@crooks1999mesopredator; @ruscoe2011unexpected; @doherty2017stop]. The release of subordinate invasive species, particularly predators, can have serious negative implications for native taxa and ecosystem function [linnell2000interference; @ballari2016potential; @courchamp1999cats]. However, integrated invasive predator management is often far more costly and less feasible than single species control, and so it is important to identify when the extra cost is justified [@bode2015eradicating]. 

Most knowledge of mesopredator release stems from unreplicated 'natural experiments' [e.g., range contractions - @crooks1999mesopredator] or ad-hoc management interventions [e.g., invasive species eradications - @rayner2007spatial] where dominant predators have become largely absent from the system. It is particularly unclear whether mesopredator release still occurs when apex predators are suppressed but not completely removed. The occurrence, nature (positive or negative, direct or indirect) and strength of predator interactions can vary among species assemblages, predation risk, environmental productivity, management regimes and other landscape contexts [@oksanen2000logic; @finke2004predator; @ritchie2009predator; @alston2019reciprocity; @elmhagen2007trophic; @baum2009cascading]. Replicating management programs in an experimental framework is logistically challenging, but important for understanding these complexities, discriminating between plausible hypotheses and producing generalisable results to inform effective pest management [@christie2019simple; @ford2015trophic]. 

Another source of uncertainty around the mesopredator release hypothesis stems from the inability of traditional survey and modelling approaches to distinguish behavioural from numerical population processes [@stephens2015management; @hayward2015ecologists; @anderson2001need]. Suppression of an dominant predator may simultaneously change the behaviour and the density of a mesopredator, both of which influence detection rates [@broadley2019density; @rogan2019influence]. This makes it difficult to interpret observed changes in naive indices of mesopredator activity or occupancy in relation to changes in dominant predator populations, even if the study has an experimental design. Unbiased estimates of invasive predator density are also important for setting meaningful control targets and inferring impacts on native prey [@moseby2019understanding]. Spatial capture-recapture methods offer a solution by separating behavioural and observational processes from population density, which is estimated within a defined spatial unit [@gardner2009hierarchical]. 

Predation by two invasive species, the red fox *Vulpes vulpes* (hereafter ‘fox’) and feral cat *Felis catus* (hereafter 'cat'), has played a major role in Australia’s high rates of mammalian extinction [@woinarski2015ongoing]. Integrated pest management programs are rare; instead, foxes are far more commonly controlled than cats, as they are more susceptible to poison baiting, have greater direct economic impacts and fewer legal impediments to control [@reddiex2007control; @mcleod2014fertility]. Nonetheless, cats are one of the most widespread and damaging vertebrate predator species [@doherty2017impacts; @medina2011global; @legge2020cat]. As foxes are larger-bodied (~2 kg difference) and have high dietary overlap with cats [@stobo2021sharing; @stobo2021reptiles; @woinarski2021compounding], the mesopredator release hypothesis  predicts that cat density, and therefore cat impacts on shared prey species will increase as fox populations are suppressed [@soule1988reconstructed; @courchamp1999cats]. This is concerning as open populations of feral cats are extremely difficult to manage  [@lazenby2015effects; @fisher2015cat].

Evidence that foxes suppress cats is inconclusive. In parts of Australia where the native dominant mammalian predator [the dingo *Canis familiaris* which arrived in Australia at least ~3,500 years ago, @balme2018new] is functionally extinct and introduced foxes are the largest terrestrial mammalian predator, four studies associated fox control with higher cat detections [@risbey2000impacts; @marlow2015cats; @stobo2020management]. However, two other studies in similar systems did not see any change [@towerton2011detecting; @molsher2017mesopredator]. A further study with spatial replication detected an increase at one site but not another [@davey2006exotic], and another observed a decrease in cat activity [@claridge2010trends]. No prior studies have directly estimated changes in cat density in response to fox control. While intraguild predator interactions depend on landscape-context [@elmhagen2007trophic; @greenville2014bottom],  more standardised and reliable population measurements need to be deployed across different landscapes to understand what factors drive the variable responses of cats to dominant predator control [@hayward2015ecologists].

We experimentally investigated the role of introduced foxes in top-down suppression of cat density in eight landscapes within two regions of south-eastern Australia. Our experiments had a replicated Control-Impact design in the region with long-term fox control, and a Before-After Control-Impact Paired-Series (BACIPS) design in the region with newly implemented fox control. Foxes and cats are the only functional medium-large sized terrestrial mammalian predators in these regions. Each region included at least one area in which foxes were subject to continuous lethal poison baiting (hereafter 'impact landscape'), and a paired area where foxes were not controlled (hereafter 'non-impact landscape'). This allowed a focus on the associations between the two invasive predators, across an artifically manipulated gradient of dominant predator (fox) occurrence probability. In accordance with mesopredator release, we predicted that: (1) cat density would be negatively correlated with fox occurrence at a fine spatial scale, and (2) fox control would be associated with higher cat densities at a landscape scale. We based inference on direct estimates of cat density using spatially explicit mark-resight models.

## Methods

### Study area
We conducted our study across two regions of south-west Victoria, Australia (Fig. \@ref(fig:density-map)). The native temperate forests in both regions are fragmented to varying degrees, primarily by livestock farming and timber plantations. Although once widespread, native dingoes are now absent throughout the study landscapes (not sighted at all despite extensive camera-trapping), and a native mesopredator, the tiger quoll *Dasyurus maculatus* is long absent from the Glenelg region and extremely rare in the Otway Ranges (last sighted in 2014 despite extensive camera-trapping). The terrestrial mammalian predator guild is therefore depauperate, with foxes and cats being the primary medium-large sized mammalian terrestrial predators; birds of prey and snakes are the only other medium-large carnivores present. 

Our study landscapes in the Glenelg region, Gunditjmara country, were primarily lowland forest and heathy woodland. The area receives an average annual rainfall of 700 mm [@BOM2021, Cashmore Airport] and has gently undulating terrain. The region frequently experiences prescribed burns and wildfires, creating a mosaic of fire histories and vegetation complexity. Our study landscapes in the Otway region were in the western section of the Otway Ranges on Gadubanud country. Rainfall here is more than twice as high as the Glenelg region [@BOM2021]. The vegetation is a mosaic of shrubby wet forest and cool temperate rainforest, with the northern landscape bordering on a large heathy woodland. This region rarely experiences fire and is nearly ten times more rugged than the Glenelg region [based on the terrain ruggedness index, @riley1999index].

Government land managers conduct ongoing targeted fox control for biodiversity conservation across broad landscapes of each region (detailed in Section 2.2 below). In these landscapes, manufactured poison baits (FoxOff, Animal Control Technologies, Somerton) containing 3 mg of sodium fluroacetate (compound 1080) are buried at a depth of 12 - 15 cm at 1-km intervals along accessible forest tracks and roads (Fig. \@ref(fig:density-map)). Different road densities across the two regions result in variable poison bait densities. Other large sections within each region are maintained without fox control. 

### Study design and camera-trapping
We designed experiments around the implementation of fox-baiting in each region. We simultaneously surveyed one impact and one non-impact landscape at a time. Each pair of impact and non-impact landscapes was chosen based on similarity in vegetation groups, while aiming to maximise spatial independence with respect to predator daily movements. 

In the Glenelg region, we used a spatially replicated Control-Impact design to compare three impact landscapes that have been poison baited for foxes at fortnightly intervals for more than 13 years with three paired non-impact landscapes. The pairing of these landscapes were based on similarities in amounts and types of vegetation classes in designing the Glenelg Ark monitoring program [@robley2014long]. We surveyed Cobboboonee National Park (impact) and Annya State Forest (non-impact) in January – April 2018 ('replicate 1'), Mt Clay State Forest/Narrawong Flora Reserve (hereafter 'Mt Clay'; impact) and Hotspur State Forest (non-impact) in April – June 2018 (‘replicate 2’), and Lower Glenelg National Park (LGNP) South (impact) and LGNP North (non-impact) in March – May 2021 (‘replicate 3’). For replicates 1 and 2, the paired landscapes were separated by at least 8 km, a distance very unlikely to be traversed regularly by these invasive predators [@hradsky2017human]. LGNP South and North are separated by the Glenelg river, which is unlikely to be traversed by most terrestrial animals. 

In the Otway region, we used a Before-After Control-Impact Paired-Series (BACIPS) design to assess changes related to the introduction of a fox control program. We deployed camera-trap grids in a pair of impact – non-impact landscapes from June to September in three years (2017, 2018, 2019), in the Great Otway National Park and Otway Forest Park. Our first survey occurred approximately three months before fox-baiting began. Fox-baiting commenced in the impact landscape in November 2017. Poison baits were replaced weekly for six weeks until December 2017, before changing to monthly bait replacement until July 2018. The second survey was conducted six months after fox-baiting commenced, however poison bait replacement ceased from near the beginning of the survey until nearly three months afterwards. Fox-baiting at monthly intervals recommenced in December 2018, six months prior to the start of the final survey (Fig. \@ref(fig:density-camop)). The impact (southern) and non-impact (northern) landscapes were at least 4.2 km apart through dense forest, a distance unlikely to be regularly traversed by these invasive predators, although possible [@hradsky2017human]. In this study, and a concurrent study which identified individual foxes through genetic sampling [@le2022genetic], we found no evidence that either foxes or cats moved between the impact and non-impact landscapes. 

In each landscape, we established a grid of 49 – 110 sites (mean: 88). We aimed to space camera-traps 500 m apart, although spacings ranged from 194 – 770 m (mean spacing: 448 m) due to accessibility and logistical constraints. We situated each site in the forest interior, at least 30 m away from roads and tracks. At each site, we set up a Reconyx branded (Holmen, Wisconsin) infrared camera-trap on a tree, facing a tuna oil lure; see Appendix C section \@ref(density-app-field) for details. Overall, we deployed 1,051 functional camera-traps, which operated for an average of 65 days (ranging 12 – 93 days), totalling 68,504 trap nights (Table \@ref(tab:density-stats)).


### Individual feral cat identification
We sorted the camera-trap images of cats into five categories based on coat type (Fig. \@ref(fig:density-cat-photo)), and identified individual feral cats within each category; see Appendix C section \@ref(density-app-id) for details. In the Otway region, 40% of cat detections were of black cats with few identifiable markings, so we did not attempt to identify any black cats here. In the Glenelg region, black cats were rarer (not detected at two landscapes) and often more distinctive, and so we could identify some individuals (Table \@ref(tab:density-stats)).


### Spatial fox occurrence {#density-methods-fox}
In lieu of simultaneous and reliable fox density estimates [foxes are not individually identifiable from camera-trap images, @guthlin2014possible], we modelled fine-scale and spatially-explicit fox occurrence probabilities. We could not use raw fox presence-absence data from the camera-traps to predict cat density, as spatial mark-resight models require covariate values for each grid cell in which density is estimated (see Section \@ref(density-methods-smr)). Instead, we generated a spatially-interpolated layer of the probability of fox occurrence for each study landscape, using fox presence-absence data for each camera-trap site and binomial generalised additive mixed-effects models [@wood2017generalized]. These models allow efficient nonlinear spatial estimates, but do not account for imperfect detection. Nonetheless, naïve fox occurrence probabilities may relate to how cats perceive risk of fox encounter across study landscapes for the entire survey duration. In some circumstances predator occurrence scales with population density [@linden2017examining], although we acknowledge this may not be the case for foxes in our study. 

We built the fox occurrence models using the ‘mgcv’ R-package [version 1.3.1, @wood2011fast]. We modelled fox presences and absences (response variable) across space (explanatory variable) separately for each region, with a duchon spline spatial smooth; these provide better predictions at the edge of surveyed space than other splines [@miller2014finite]. In the Otway region, we included a random intercept for each camera-trap site to account for repeat sampling and did not share spatial information across years. Differences in camera-trap deployment lengths were accounted for using a model offset. 


### Spatial mark-resight models of feral cat density {#density-methods-smr}
We used a spatial capture-recapture approach to estimate cat density [@borchers2008spatially]. These models use counts of detections and non-detections of individual animals at trap locations (accounting for trap-specific survey effort) to estimate the location of each individual’s activity centre. They commonly assume that individuals have approximately circular home ranges, spend the majority of time in the centre of their range ('activity centre'), and that the probability of observing an individual decreases with distance from the activity centre. Two detectability parameters govern this process: *g*~0~, the probability of detecting an individual per occasion in their activity centre, and sigma: a spatial scale parameter which relates to home range size. Multiple candidate shapes for the decline in detectability with distance from the activity centre ('detection function') can be modelled, although half-normal and exponential are most commonly used. Spatial capture-recapture models have been extended to consider situations where not all individuals in a population are identifiable [i.e., some are unmarked, @chandler2013spatially]. These models typically assume unmarked individuals to be a random sample of the population, sharing the same detection process as marked individuals, allowing density to be estimated for the entire population.

We used sighting-only spatial mark-resight models to estimate cat density using the maximum likelihood ‘secr’ R-package [@efford2021secr]. We used closed population models as open population spatial mark-resight models have not yet been developed. Detections of the 'mark status uncertain' category (unidentifiable cats), cannot be handled in the 'secr' R package; we added them to as ‘unmarked’ detections (black cats) rather than discard them [following @moseby2020effectiveness]. We condensed unmarked detection histories to a binary presence-absence record per each camera-trap for a 24-hour length duration ('occasion'), beginning at midday. We ran separate models for each region and treated each camera-trap grid deployment as a 'session'. We created a 4000-m buffer zone around each site (which was truncated by the river in LGNP), and estimated cat density at a 200-m grid cell resolution within this area. These habitat mask specifications were based on initial model trials and our knowledge of cat behaviour in these regions; the aim was to ensure density was estimated over a large enough area to encompass the activity centres of all cats exposed to our camera-traps, at a fine enough spatial scale to minimise bias in density estimates. 

For each region, we ran four sets of models. We (1) chose between half-normal and exponential detection functions and (2) chose 'base model' covariates to carry through to subsequent model sets, as well as (3) tested for associations between fox occurrence probabilities and cat density at a fine spatial scale, and (4) evaluated the effect of fox control on cat density at the landscape scale with traditional experimental approaches. We compared competing models using small-sample corrected Akaike Information Criterion (hereafter 'AIC~c~') scores [@burnham2004multimodel] and examined the confidence intervals around estimated model coefficients. Each step (2 - 4) is described in more detail below.

After deciding between the half-normal and exponential detector functions, the second set of models established the base covariates for each region. We hypothesised that cat detectability might decrease over each survey due to the scent of the tuna oil lure fading. To account for this, we modelled a non-linear trend in *g*~0~ over the survey duration for each camera-trap. We used a range of camera-trap models which may impact detection rates (Table \@ref(tab:cam-models)). We tested whether camera-trap model impacted cat detection rates in the Otways (but not the Glenelg region as 97% of cameras here were the HC600 model; 3% were the PC900 model which primarily differ only in software functions), using camera-trap model as a categorical variable (n = 5) on *g*~0~. We further hypothesised that cat density might differ between vegetation types. We classed the vegetation into three dominant types for each region: cleared land, heathy vegetation, and either dry forest (Glenelg region) or wet forest (Otway region); see Appendix \@ref(density-app-veg) for details. We compared these covariates as single and additive models, as well as to a ‘null model’ (density and detectability constant) - carrying supported covariates forward to subsequent model fits. 

The third set of models directly tested the associations between fine-scale fox occurrence and cats within each region. We tested three models where (i) fox occurrence probability only affected cat density, (ii) fox occurrence probability only affected cat detectability [both *g*~0~ and sigma concurrently, @efford2014compensatory], (iii) fox occurrence probability affected both the density and the detectability of cats, against the null model with no association between fox occurrence and cats. We used the spatial fox occurrence probability estimates (detailed in Section \@ref(density-methods-fox)) as the explanatory variable. As predator associations may be nonlinear [@johnson2009evidence], we tested these effects as linear and non-linear terms using regression splines (generalised additive models called within the ‘secr’ R-package). We included year as a cat density covariate in all the Otway region models to account for repeat sampling and compared to a null model without any fox occurrence effects using AIC~c~ scores.

The fourth set of models inferred the effects of fox-baiting at a landscape scale within each region using traditional experimental designs. We fit models which estimated cat density separately for each landscape, and used AIC~c~ scores to choose whether to model detectability as a function of predicted fox occurrence probability (as per hypothesis ii in the second set of models above) or constant. For the top-ranked model, we then calculated the estimated difference in cat density between paired landscape surveys (on the natural logarithmic scale), assessing the weight of statistical evidence using associated confidence intervals. Following traditional approaches, we used an arbitrary p-value threshold of 0.05 to indicate a binary measure of statistical significance; below 0.05 signals sufficient evidence for an effect, above 0.05 does not [although it is worth iterating that p-values provide gradients of statistical evidence, @muff2021rewriting]. In the paragraphs below, we explain how the estimated difference between treatment sites is used to assess Control-Impact (CI) and Before-After-Control-Impact (BACI) experiments [for more information see @goldstein1995graphical; @christie2019simple].

In CI experiments (Glenelg region), the difference between control (here we refer to as 'non-impact' sites to avoid confusion with fox control) and impact sites is attributed to the focal effect - fox control (a strong assumption, although some background differences between landscapes can be accounted for with model covariates, such as vegetation type on cat density in our case). Statistical evidence of a difference using a p-value threshold of 0.05 is achieved when the 95% confidence interval of the estimated difference does not cross zero (on the log scale). We repeated this analysis three times in the Glenelg region, once for each landscape pair. To signify mesopredator release, the estimated difference in cat density between landscape pairs needs to be higher in the impact landscape relative to the non-impact landscape (i.e., a positive difference).

In BACI experiments (Otway region), changes in the estimated difference between control and impact sites over time is attributed to the focal effect (fox control). BACI experiments are therefore more robust than CI experiments because they explicitly account for pre-impact differences between treatment sites. Instead of focusing on the estimated difference between sites (as in CI experiments; often viewed vertically in plots), BACI studies assess changes in successive estimates of difference (often viewed horizontally in plots). Statistical evidence for a change over time can be provided by the degree of overlap in confidence intervals between successive estimates of difference between treatment sites. A p-value threshold of below 0.05 is reached once 83% confidence intervals do not overlap (note that an absence of overlap between 95% confidence intervals signals a p-value less than 0.005 - a much more stringent assessment). To signify mesopredator release, a positive change in cat density needs to be observed in the impact landscape relative to the non-impact landscape.

## Results

### Fox occurrence
In the Glenelg region, there was a clear difference in fox occurrence between paired impact (poison baited) and non-impact landscapes for replicates 1 and 3, but only a marginal difference for replicate 2 (Fig. \@ref(fig:foxplot)). In the Otway region, the probability fox occurrence increased by 22% in the non-impact landscape, and decreased by 43% in the impact landscape over the three years (occurrence probability averaged at each camera-trap in the landscape). Fox occurrence in the Otway region was generally lower than the Glenelg region, with less fine-scale spatial variation. For example, fox occurrence was predicted to be spatially consistent across the entire Otway region in 2018 (Fig. \@ref(fig:foxplot)). Proportion of camera-traps foxes were detected on per landscape are shown in Table \@ref(tab:tab-dates); fox model summaries and spatial standard error estimates are presented in Appendix \@ref(density-app-fox).

### Feral cats in the Glenelg region 
Across the six landscapes in the Glenelg region, we recorded 251 cat detections from 32,232 camera-trap nights (Table \@ref(tab:density-stats)). We were able to identify 64% of cat detections to the individual level; a total of 67 cats (6 – 13 individuals per landscape). The exponential detector function was supported over the half-normal function (Table \@ref(tab:density-aic-g-1)). The null model was more strongly supported than models with vegetation impacts on cat density and/or linear time trends on *g*~0~ (Table \@ref(tab:density-aic-g-2)). 

At a fine spatial scale, the model with a linear relationship between fox occurrence and cat density was strongly supported (AIC~c~ 4.26 better than the null; Table \@ref(tab:density-aic-g-3)). It indicated that cat density declined as fox occurrence probabilities increased (-0.32; 95% CI: -0.57 - -0.07; Fig. \@ref(fig:dcor)). There was no evidence of an impact of fox occurrence on cat detectability (Table \@ref(tab:density-aic-g-3)). Regression splines added additional model parameters without changing predictions (Fig. \@ref(fig:dcor)), and so, all nonlinear models ranked below their linear counterparts (Table \@ref(tab:density-aic-g-3)).

Our hypothesis that cat density would be higher in landscapes with fox control was supported for the first and third replicate pairs: estimated cat densities were 2.5 (95% CI: 1.5 - 4.2) and 3.7 (95% CI: 1.4 - 9.5) times higher in the impact landscape than the paired non-impact landscape, respectively (Fig. \@ref(fig:diffg)). There was no difference in density between landscape pairs in the second spatial replicate (Fig. \@ref(fig:diffg)). At the landscape level, there was some evidence that cat detectability was affected by fox occurrence; however the AIC~c~ score was only 0.95 units better than the constant detectability model (Table \@ref(tab:density-aic-g-4)) and the estimated effects were weak with high uncertainty. This model estimated the detectability of cats in their activity centre (*g*~0~) to increase with the probability of fox occurrence (0.24; 95% CI: -0.32 - 0.80), as did sigma (0.13; 95% CI: -0.14 - 0.41).

### Feral cats in the Otway region 
In the Otway region, we recorded 970 cat detections from 36,272 camera-trap nights (Table \@ref(tab:density-stats)). We were able to identify 53% of cat detections to the individual level; a total of 93 cats (20 – 30 individuals per landscape). The exponential detector function was strongly supported over the half-normal function (Table \@ref(tab:density-aic-o-1)). The null model was more strongly supported than the models with vegetation impacts on cat density, as well as camera-trap model and linear time trends on *g*~0~ (Table \@ref(tab:density-aic-o-2)). 

There was some evidence that cat density was negatively correlated with fox occurrence at a fine spatial scale: the two top-ranked models included a linear and a non-linear effect of fox occurrence on cat density, respectively; however, a model without a fox occurrence term received similar support (dAIC~c~ = 0.80; Table \@ref(tab:density-aic-o-3)). The 95% confidence interval around the linear coefficient from the top-ranked model marginally overlapped zero (-0.26; 95% CI: -0.55 - 0.02) indicating that cat density declined as fox occurrence probabilities increased in the Otways at a similar rate to Glenelg, but with slightly greater uncertainty (Fig. \@ref(fig:dcor)). However, the equivalent nonlinear model predicted that cat density only declined (at a steeper rate) in the mid-high range of fox occurrence probability (Fig. \@ref(fig:dcor)). Equivalent pairs of linear model and nonlinear models were indistinguishable based on AIC~c~ scores (Table \@ref(tab:density-aic-o-3)). There was also strong support for an effect of fox occurrence on cat detectability at a fine spatial scale (Fig. \@ref(fig:detcor); Table \@ref(tab:density-aic-o-4)). Where fox occurrence was higher, cats were less detectable in their activity centres (i.e., negative association with *g*~0~; -0.69; 95% CI: -1.11 - -0.27; Fig. \@ref(fig:detcor)a) and ranged further (i.e., positive association with sigma; coefficient 0.30; 95% CI: 0.13 - 0.47; Fig. \@ref(fig:detcor)b). The equivalent nonlinear model predicted detectability changes to have occurred only in the low-mid range of fox occurrence (Fig. \@ref(fig:detcor)).

Our hypothesis that cat density in the impact landscape would increase relative to the non-impact landscape with fox control was supported in 2019, but not 2018. Cat density was estimated to be lower in the impact than non-impact landscape prior to fox-baiting (i.e., in 2017; Fig. \@ref(fig:diffo)). In 2018, cat density decreased in the non-impact landscape and increased in the impact landscape, converging to near-identical density estimates. These patterns continued at the same rate into 2019, with cat density estimated to be higher in the impact landscape than the non-impact landscape. There was not statistical evidence that the difference between cat density in landscape pair had changed from 2017 to 2018 as these 83% confidence intervals overlapped, but there was weak statistical evidence of an relative increase in cat density in the impact landscape from 2017 to 2019 as these 83% confidence intervals narrowly avoided overlap (Fig. \@ref(fig:diffo)b). Like the fine-scale model, there was strong evidence that cat detectability was impacted by fox occurrence (Table \@ref(tab:density-aic-o-4)).

## Discussion

Our study is one of the first to provide replicated, experimental evidence that dominant predator suppression is associated with higher mesopredator densities. Our study provides two lines of evidence that foxes can exert top-down control on feral cats in the forests of south-eastern Australia: feral cat density was (1) higher where fine-scale fox occurrence probability was lowest (although this association was uncertain in the Otway region), and (2) commonly higher in landscapes where fox control occurred. This is concerning because targeted fox control is a widely used conservation strategy; this unintended consequence could dampen benefits to native prey and even further threaten these species [@courchamp1999cats; @wayne2017recoveries]. However, as our findings highlight, mesopredator release of cats following fox control depends on the degree of fox suppression. More broadly, our study illustrates how correlative and experimental approaches provide complementary lines of evidence when investigating interactions between predator species, and the importance of disentangling changes in population density from changes in detectability.

We were able to exploit a gradient in fox occurrence probability caused by lethal control to investigate associations between cat density and fox occurrence at a fine spatial scale across two separate regions. At this scale, we observed a consistently negative association between cat density and fox occurrence probabilities, supporting our first hypothesis. While AICc scores indicated that cat density had negative associations with fox occurrence probabilities across both regions, only this association in the the Glenelg region was statistically significant (95% confidence intervals for this coefficient narrowly overlapped zero in the Otway region). Negative spatial associations between species may simply reflect differences in niche preference rather than exclusion or avoidance, although is less likely in our case given we observed the relationship across an artificial gradient of fox occurrence probability caused by lethal control. Cats may respond more closely to fox occurrence at broader spatial scales (i.e., the landscape level), or to fox activity (i.e., counts of detections rather than presence-absence). This is worth future investigation, particularly as simultaneously estimating fox density from camera-trap surveys remains unreliable due to the inability to identify individual foxes from photographs [@guthlin2014possible]. 

There is contention around whether linear regression is appropriate for investigating correlations between different predator species, as subordinate predators may only be suppressed when dominant predator abundance is high [@johnson2009evidence; @letnic2011does]. We found no evidence of non-linear associations between foxes and cats in the Glenelg region, while linear and non-linear models performed equally well in the Otway region. Non-linear models in the Otway region predicted that cat density declined only in the mid-high range of fox occurrence, while behavioural changes were seen in the low-mid range of fox occurrence. Perhaps cats can successfully avoid foxes through behavioural change where foxes are rare, but this is ineffective where foxes are common. This could explain the lack of evidence for foxes impacting cat detectability in the Glenelg region where fox occupancy is relatively high. Alternatively, behavioural changes may be untenable for cats in the Glenelg region because small mammal abundance is relatively low (M.Rees, unpublished data) and fox avoidance strategies likely come at the expense of hunting success [@sih1980optimal; @wilson2010prey].

Where fox occurrence was higher in the Otway Ranges, cats were less detectable in their activity centres and ranged further (Fig. \@ref(fig:detcor)). Low detectability is likely to correlate with fewer dominant predator encounters, and has been observed in other predator interaction studies [e.g., @lombardi2017coyote]. An increase in cat ranging behaviour (sigma) with fox control supports observations made by @molsher2017mesopredator using telemetry, and may reflect a direct avoidance strategy. Animal movement rates are expected to increase in response to unpredictable threats [@riotte-lambert2020environmental]. Alternatively, cats may consider foxes predictable and avoid locations they frequent, thus having to range further to obtain the same amount of food resources. In a similar forest habitat, @buckmaster2012ecology observed large 'holes' in the home range of each GPS-collared cat; they confirmed that this was not due to an absence of prey and hypothesised it was due to dominant predator avoidance. Further, in similar forest habitat without any foxes or dingoes, cats tend to have compact home ranges within which their intensity of use is reasonably uniform, suggesting this to be an optimal strategy for cats  [@hamer2021triple]. A more extended home range used in a patchy fashion, might therefore be a suboptimal strategy for cats. Regardless of the cause, variation in mesopredator detectability and movement rates with dominant predator populations has serious implications for the interpretation of studies that simply compare relative abundance indices or spatial overlap of predator species without disentangling behaviour and detectability from density [@efford2012occupancy; @broadley2019density; @neilson2018animal; @stewart2018species]. 

In the Glenelg region where fox-baiting had occurred for more than 13 years, feral cat density was considerably higher in two out of three distinct landscapes than in similar, unbaited landscapes. The outlier is most likely due to limited suppression of foxes at Mt Clay despite ongoing fox control (Fig. \@ref(fig:foxplot)a). Mt Clay is a small forest block surrounded entirely by unbaited farmland; simulation modelling indicates that the size of the baited area is a key driver of the degree of reduction in the fox population [@hradsky2019foxnet; @francis2020evaluating]. 

In the Otway region, we observed seemingly opposing patterns of fox occurrence probabilities in the impact and non-impact landscapes over time (Fig. \@ref(fig:foxplot)b). We are unsure what drove the increase in fox occurrence probability in the non-impact landscape and whether it was related to fox control in the nearby impact landscape, although this provides an explanation as to why cat density increased in the non-impact site (Fig. \@ref(fig:diffo)a). The effects observed in our BACIPS study are therefore only partly due to mesopredator release in the strict sense (i.e., due to fox suppression), although demonstrate reciprocity in responses of cats to both increases and declines in foxes, which is rarely observed [@alston2019reciprocity]. Perhaps changes in the non-impact landscape were due to changes in prey availability, although we do not expect large fluctuations in prey here given the low seasonality and consistent climatic conditions relative to other parts of the country. Studies of fox-cat (and other intraguild predator) interactions often use the presence of a management program as a proxy for dominant predator suppression [e.g., @hunter2018not]. Our findings strongly indicate the need to directly measure the dominant predator population in order to reliably interpret the responses of subordinate species [@salo2010predator].

In the Otway region, we observed a weak&mdash;but increasing&mdash;effect of fox control on cat density, to be expected from a recently commenced fox-baiting program. We consider two possible explanations for the weaker response of cats to fox control in the Otway Ranges than the Glenelg region. Firstly, the short duration of baiting in the Otway region may mean that changes in adult cat density are yet to fully manifest. We found some evidence for a sequential response of first, a relaxation of behavioural mediation - potentially improving hunting success and recruitment rates, may in-turn cause a subsequent increase in cat density. Additionally, foxes are more likely to be effective at killing younger cats which are more vulnerable, and so may have a greater impact on cat recruitment rates rather than the adult popultion. Further, cats may also respond to an increase in shared prey availability following fox suppression [@stobo2020management]. A time-lagged release of cats following fox control would explain eruptions and subsequent crashes commonly observed in shared mammalian prey populations two to ten years following fox control commencement [@duncan2020eruptive]. 

Secondly, foxes may have a weak suppressive effect on cats in the highly productive Otway region. Fox occurrence (Fig. \@ref(fig:foxplot)) and density was already relatively low prior to fox control in the Otways [@le2022genetic], limiting their suppressive effects on cats. Additionally, competition theory predicts competitive interactions to be weaker with high prey availability; there is likely less imperative for foxes to be aggressive towards cats when there is enough food to share [@johnson2009evidence; @greenville2014bottom]. On the other hand, foxes may have a higher capacity to maintain vigilance against cats when they are not food stressed, and top-down control from dominant predators may be the only limiting factor of this generalist mesopredator in resource-rich environments [@elmhagen2007trophic; @oksanen2000logic; @feit2019apex]. Prey availability is likely a strong mediator of mesopredator release, although it remains unclear whether mesopredator release would be stronger where prey availability is low or high&mdash;severely limiting our ability to predict mesopredator release across different landscapes. 

Perhaps the most obvious omission in our study is therefore trends in prey. It is difficult to ascertain whether mesopredator release was stronger in the Glenelg or Otway regions because of the different length of times foxes had been controlled for, although the negative associations between cat density and fox occurrence was only marginally stronger in the Glenelg region than the Otway. Teasing apart the relative importance of fox and prey associations with feral cat density will be important for both understanding the mechanisms, and accurately predicting mesopredator release of cats across different landscapes. Another limitation of our approach is that uncertainty from our fox occurrence models was not propagated into the spatial mark-resight models. A full Bayesian integration of the fox occurrence analysis and the spatial mark-resight model to address this is not yet implemented. The development of open population spatial mark-resight models would also improve parameter estimates for repeat surveys in landscapes. 

Nevertheless, our study is among the very few which have used a direct measure of density to test mesopredator release. Previous studies have mostly used live capture-rates to infer population density, without accounting for behavioural or detectability changes [e.g., @arjo2007changes; @karki2007effects; @thompson2007food; @berger2008indirect; @jones2008sudden]. Contention about mesopredator release has centred on such methods [@hayward2015ecologists], as well as unaccounted species interactions in complex predator guilds [@levi2012wolves; @jachowski2020identifying]. In contrast, our study tests the mesopredator release theory using a combined behavioural and numerical approach, in a system with a simplified carnivore guild. Further replication of our approach in new landscapes, as well as explictly accounting for prey species or landscape productivity is a priority for improving understanding of mesopredator release. However, it is extremely difficult to find comparable landscapes and as we have shown, binary variables for predator control overlook important ecological nuance. Testing associations between dominant and subordinate predators across wider gradients of productivity and predator control effort may even provide more accurate inference than additional replicated experiments with traditional designs [@kreyling2018replicate], and could be achieved using data already collected.  

The results of our study may explain why pest management that only targets foxes&mdash;one of the most prevalent conservation actions in Australia&mdash;does not consistently improve native prey persistence [@wayne2017recoveries; @lindenmayer2018conservation; @robley2014long; @duncan2020eruptive; @dexter2009impact]. More evidence is required to understand the circumstances in which lethal fox control increases cat density, particularly the role of baseline fox and prey densities. A more integrated approach to invasive predator management, where foxes and cats are simultaneously or otherwise optimally controlled could substantially improve biodiversity outcomes [@comer2020integrating; @risbey2000impacts]. If this is not feasible, changes in invasive mesopredator density and the outcomes for native prey species should be closely monitored as part of any control program for invasive dominant predators, with triggers for ceasing dominant predator control or commencing integrated management if single-species control proves counterproductive for the conservation of threatened prey species.

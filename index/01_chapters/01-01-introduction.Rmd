# General Introduction 

## Mesopredator release hypothesis 

"In the absence of large predators, smaller predators can become more abundant (mesopredator release) and, in turn, may cause the local extinction of vulnerable prey species." - @soule1988reconstructed. 

Against a backdrop of growing evidence that subordinate predator species ‘undergo population explosions’ in the absence of dominant predators, @soule1988reconstructed first coined 'mesopredator release'. @soule1988reconstructed found that where coyotes *Canis latrans* were absent in California, U.S.A, domestic cats *Felis catus* were more prevalent and populations of native birds succumbed to extinction. There have since been many other high-profile examples of the mesopredator release across a wide-range of taxa, spanning Europe [@elmhagen2007trophic], Africa [@gorman1998high], Australia [@johnson2007rarity] and in many marine systems [@baum2009cascading]. Grounded in traditional-food web ecological theory, the mesopredator release hypothesis (hereafter 'MRH') is a simple and intuitive hypothesis. So why, 33 years later, does the MRH remain highly contentious? 

Firstly, there is a lack of replicated, robust evidence for the MRH for many ecosystems. This is partly because it is often difficult to obtain sufficient data to quantify changes in subordinate predator behaviour and density, particularly within an experimental design [@glen2007evaluating]. Predators are typically cryptic and occur widely across broad landscapes, at low densities. Hence very large areas may need to be surveyed intensively to obtain sufficient sample sizes [@royle2008statistical]. Furthermore, spatially-independent but otherwise similar landscapes without top predator declines can be difficult to find [e.g. @dexter2009impact]. Without robust experimental designs, it is difficult to attribute changes in mesopredator populations to apex predator declines [@hayward2015ecologists]. 

Secondly, evidence for the MRH often relies on vague population metrics. Dominant predators can suppress subordinate predators through direct killing, resource competition and fear-induced behavioural changes [@ritchie2009predator]. Mesopredator release was originally defined as a numerical increase in subordinate predator population density following apex predator decline [@soule1988reconstructed], but has since been expanded to also include changes in distribution and behaviour [@brashares2010ecological]. Many of the North American field studies reviewed by @jachowski2020identifying provided mixed support for MRH because different population metrics provided conflicting inference. @jachowski2020identifying called for clearer separation of spatial, numerical and behavioural processes, which are often wrapped together in commonly used "abundance" indices [@stephens2015management]. It is particularly important to account for changes in subordinate predator detectability when testing mesopredator release, because a relaxation of subordinate predator behaviour may be falsely interpreted as an increase in abundance (**ref**). The few examples of mesopredator release that have directly estimated changes in population density (rather than rely on an index) have mostly used live capture-rates to infer mesopredator population density [e.g. @arjo2007changes; @karki2007effects; @thompson2007food; @berger2008indirect; @jones2008sudden]. This approach still fails to account for behavioural changes which may have, for example, made individuals more trappable. Moreover, these traditional survey and statistical methods have an ill-defined spatial extent; this is problematic because sampling scale can bias perceived species interactions [@guillaume2020co-occurrence; @efford2012occupancy].  

Thirdly, the MRH can be an overly simplistic representation of complex ecosystems. Most evidence for mesopredator release comes from North America and other regions with many co-occurring apex predators [@ritchie2009predator]. MRH refers to a singular, direct negative association between a dominant predator and a subordinate predator species, overlooking the complex webs of positive, negative, direct, indirect and probably nonlinear interactions which occur in multipredator systems [@levi2012wolves; @prugh2020enemies; @finke2004predator; @johnson2007rarity]. Additionally, bottom-up processes (such as ecosystem productivity and prey availability) can interact with top-down processes to determine the prevalence and strength of mesopredator release [@elmhagen2007trophic; @greenville2014bottom; @oksanen2000logic]. In these circumstances, intensive multispecies monitoring and sophisticated statistical analyses are likely to be required to distinguish mesopredator release from the background drivers of predator populations, but this has rarely taken place [@jachowski2020identifying]. 

In the context of the MRH, the dominant predator species is often referred to as an ‘apex’ or ‘top’ predator, and subordinate species as ‘meso-’ or ‘middle-rank’ predators. This can be confusing because a particular species may function as a dominant predator in one system or context, and a subordinate  predator in another. For example, in the classic Californian MRH example, coyotes *Canis latrans* are described as an apex predator as they are the largest carnivore present [@crooks1999mesopredator]; however, coyotes evolved as mesopredators in systems with larger carnivores, such as wolves *Canis lupus* [e.g. @berger2008indirect]. @wallach2015apex argues that the term apex predator term should be reserved for predators that self-regulate their own population densities, by limiting their reproductive and recruitment rates, and exhibit cooperative and territorial behaviours. These tend to be large species above 13 – 16 kg [@wallach2015apex]. Meanwhile, they define mesopredators as predators that are regulated by extrinsic factors (top-down and bottom-up control) and have fast reproductive rates. These species tend to be smaller, generalists and more susceptible to mesopredator release, responding quickly to the removal of top-down control [@wallach2015apex; @prugh2009rise]. Mesopredators may even exploit the available prey more thoroughly following release, as their honed behaviours allow them to use resources efficiently while under persecution. Hence mesopredators often thrive in human-dominated landscapes and become successful invasive species in locations outside their natural distribution (where they may be the largest predator present) [@prugh2009rise; @vance2007influence; @holt1997theoretical]. 

A lack of understanding of the conditions that lead to mesopredator release hinders effective conservation management. Around the world, the functioning of ecosystems has been degraded by apex predator declines [@ripple2014status; @heithaus2008predicting]. Managers need to be able to predict outcomes of continued top predator declines [@estes2011trophic], as well as improvements [@chapron2014recovery] and reintroductions [@baker2017ensemble]. Simultaneously, some mesopredators have spread far beyond their native ranges [@wallach2015novel]; these ‘invasive’ predators are a leading cause of global biodiversity and economic decline [@bellard2016global; @doherty2016invasive]. Accordingly, lethal control of invasive predators is a prevalent management strategy worldwide. However, when multiple invasive predator species occur, single species control can often backfire and worsen outcomes for native species [@ballari2016potential; @doherty2017stop]. This is most likely due to the release of subordinate invasive species [e.g. @rayner2007spatial]. A better understanding of the interactions between invasive predator species is key to improving conservation outcomes [@zavaleta2001viewing]. 

Debate over the MRH rages in Australia--a continent that has 'institutionalised' poisoning predators [@philip2019institutionalisation]. The dingo *Canis familiaris* is Australia's native mammalian apex predator is widely persecuted, mainly for agricultural benefits [@smith2015dingo]. This is thought to have promoted the spread and increased the density and impact of two invasive mesopredators, the red fox *Vulpes vulpes* (hereafter 'fox') and feral cat (hereafter 'cat'), in turn contributing to Australia ongoing extinction crisis [@wallach2010predator; @johnson2007rarity; @newsome2017top; @woinarski2015ongoing]. Literature covering the dingo-debate hypothesises that both foxes and cats can benefit from dingo decline. Alternative theory predicts an among-carnivore cascade [@levi2012wolves]: in a dingo (~15 kg) - fox (~6 kg) - cat (~4 kg) hierarchy, dingo suppression would benefit foxes and consequently disadvantage cats. Competition between these invasive predators should be high; foxes and cats occupy a similar niche with high dietary overlap [@glen2005complex; @stobo2021reptiles; @stobo2021sharing]. 

Evidence that foxes exert top-down pressure on cats in Australia is unclear [@hunter2018not]. The strongest evidence comes from targeted lethal fox control programs in southern Australia. In these regions, dingoes are often absent and so the medium-large mammalian carnivore guild comprises only these two invasive mesopredators. Here, the larger fox is expected to fill the role of an apex predator, with the cat being subordinate [@glen2005complex]. In these regions, foxes are also widely managed for biodiversity conservation within protected areas; however, few fox management programs have demonstrated improvements in native biodiversity and several long-term studies have reported perverse outcomes [@wayne2017recoveries; @marlow2015cats; @lindenmayer2018conservation; @duncan2020eruptive; @dexter2009impact; @kinnear2016fox]. Mesopredator release of cats is commonly suspected to be the cause [although, @duncan2020eruptive offers an alternative hypothesis regarding prey overshooting carrying capacities]. The @risbey2000impacts exclusion experiment offers a compelling case study: shared prey declined by 80% in landscapes with targeted fox control (also declined relative to a landscape without any management), but prey trajectories improved where both foxes and cats were controlled. 

On average, cat activity (i.e., abundance indices) appears to increase following targeted fox control, but this estimate is uncertain [@hunter2018not], and fails to distinguish changes in cat behaviour from changes in cat density. Notably, @molsher2017mesopredator found no difference in the relative abundance (spotlight counts) but observed changes in cat diet (increased invertebrate and carrion consumption) and space use (smaller home-ranges and increased foraging in relatively open habitats) following fox control. Changes in feral cat density in response to fox control have not been directly estimated. Distinguishing numerical population change from behavioural changes is a clear priority for improving the understanding of fox-cat interactions, mesopredator release and invasive predator management approaches in Australia. 

My thesis aims to examine the mesopredator release of cats following fox control from several different angles, using experimental designs replicated across two regions of south-eastern Australia. In accordance with the MRH, I expected that lethal control fox control would increase cat occurrence and density, and alter cat behaviour. I firstly investigated whether top predator control effort was associated with an increase in the occupancy rates of a mesopredator (Chapter 3). I secondly estimated direct changes in mesopredator density following top predator suppression using traditional experimental designs, while accounting for changes in detectability (Chapter 4). I thirdly investigated how top predator activity influenced the spatiotemporal behaviour of a mesopredator through a 'landscape of fear' [@laundre2001wolves]; Chapter 5). These chapters highlight the different ways in which mesopredator release can manifest and how different population metrics provide different inferences on the MRH. 

Testing the MRH in a simple predator guild comprising of the invasive fox and cat, and experimentally surveying landscapes with and without lethal fox control (1080 poison-baiting) allowed a sharp focus on the interactions between these two invasive predators across experimental gradients of top predator activity [@kreyling2018replicate]. It also facilitated some examination of the resulting impacts on two threatened native prey species, and an investigation of the bottom-up drivers of invasive predator and threatened native mammal occurrence, including the effect of fire across different vegetation type, rainfall patterns and habitat fragmentation.  

Much of our current understanding of the ecology and impacts of invasive predators in Australia comes from semi-arid and arid regions [@legge2017enumerating; @doherty2015critical]; my research provides some of the first investigations of invasive predator density, distributions and interactions within temperate forest ecosystems, particularly wet and cool temperate rainforests. Such experimental studies in these environments have been previously called for [@glen2005complex; @doherty2015critical; @legge2017enumerating; @hayward2015ecologists]. I therefore aim to shed light on optimal methods for monitoring and managing of invasive predators for the benefit native species in temperate, heterogeneous landscapes.

## Study species
This thesis focuses on two invasive predators, the red fox and feral cat. Foxes and cats in Australia share a similar functional niche and compete for many of the same resources [@glen2005complex]. Chapter 3 also investigates the impact of fox control on two of their shared native mammalian prey species, the southern brown bandicoot (hereafter 'SBB') *Isodon obesulus* and long-nosed potoroo (hereafter 'LNP') *Potorous tridactylus*, listed as threatened under federal legislation (*Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999*). Both prey species are solitary, medium-sized, ground-dwelling marsupials. They nest in dense understorey vegetation during the day and turn over large quantities of soil to feed on invertebrates, plant material and fungi at night [@van2008mammals]. More species-specific ecological information is provided below. 

### Red fox 
Introduced to Australia in the early 1870s, European red foxes (~6 kg) are now ubiquitous across the Australian mainland except for tropical areas to the north [@fairfax2019dispersal]. Foxes can be highly territorial. They live in family groups comprising a dominant pair and their juvenile cubs. In productive areas, territories are small, more rigidly defended and adult offspring are more likely to remain with the group and help the dominant vixen raise cubs ('helper foxes')--resulting in higher population densities. Foxes are classically considered mesopredators, particularly because many of these behaviours break down in highly productive agricultural environments and urban areas, reaching high population densities (> 4 foxes km^-2^). However, foxes do have many apex predator-like self-regulating behaviours: reproductive limitation, infanticide, alloparental care and strong territoriality [@wallach2015apex]. Foxes follow seasonal behavioural patterns: mating occurs in winter, cubs are born in spring (average litter sizes being 3 to 6 cubs), and offspring tend to disperse in autumn. Foxes are omnivorous and true generalists; taking advantage of all available prey and frequently scavenge carcasses [@fleming2021diet]--foxes are easy targets of poison-baiting campaigns [@mcleod2014fertility]. Notable differences from the diet of cats include small livestock, large macropods and fruits [@stobo2021sharing].

### Feral cat 
It is hard to think of a more adaptable and widely distributed terrestrial mammalian predator than the feral cat (~4 kg). It took less than a century for cats to spread across the entire Australian continent following colonisation [@abbott2008spread], owing to their wide thermal tolerance and not relying on free-standing drinking water. Feral cats are obligatory carnivores, preferring live prey but occasionally scavenge [@doherty2015continental]. They do not readily take most types of meat bait, particularly in temperate regions with abundant prey [@fisher2015cat]. Cats are largely solitary across Australia’s typical natural environments, although they can form dense matrilineal societies in areas with rich resources (e.g., farms, rubbish tips, seabird colonies). Densities in more natural Australian environments range from 0.01 to 1.5 cats km^-2^ [@legge2017enumerating]. Female cat home-range size scales negatively with landscape productivity [@bengsen2016feral], from less than 100 ha to more than 600 ha [@hamerdiffering]. Male cat home-range size varies with that of females, but is larger on average because dominant males typically overlap the ranges of two to three females. Some individuals do not have a fixed home-range [@roshier2021space]. Feral cats can breed several times a year with litters of up to five kittens [@jones1982ecology]. 
Feral cats are indeed true mesopredators. 

### Southern brown bandicoot
The 'SBB' (~1.2 kg) *Isodon obesulus* occurs in isolated populations across the southern coast of the Australia mainland and in Tasmania. SBBs are mostly found in heathy landscapes, woodlands and dry forests. SBBs are solitary, with home-ranges varying from 0.5 - 6 ha [@lobert1990home]. Females have remarkable reproductive rates: a gestation period of 11 days, producing two - three litters per breeding season (6 month duration), averaging two to four young, who become independent after 60 days [@brown2010national]. Estimates of mainland SBB density average approximately 130 individuals km^-2^ [@pentland1999population].

### Long-nosed potoroo 
The LNP (~1.3 kg) *Potorous tridactylus* has a patchy distribution down the eastern coast of Australia from south-eastern Queensland to south-eastern South Australia; it also occurs throughout the north and east coasts of Tasmania. LNPs occupy a wide range of vegetation communities, from heathlands to rainforests. Females give birth to a single young up to four times a year, and provide each with ~133 days of lactation in the pouch [@frankham2011population]. In south-west Victoria, LNPs have a 1.4 - 2 ha home-range [@bennett1987conservation]. LNP populations are generally small, at densities of 20 - 60 individuals km^-2^, with low rates of juvenile recruitment and individual turnover [@mason1998habitat; @frankham2011population].

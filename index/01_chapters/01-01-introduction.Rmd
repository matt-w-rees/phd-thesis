# General Introduction 

"In the absence of large predators, smaller predators can become more abundant (mesopredator release) and, in turn, may cause the local extinction of vulnerable prey species." - @soule1988reconstructed. 

Against a backdrop of growing evidence that top predators can apply top-down pressure on subordinate predator species, @soule1988reconstructed first coined 'mesopredator release'. @soule1988reconstructed found that where coyotes *Canis latrans* were absent in California, U.S.A, domestic cats *Felis catus* were more prevalent and populations of native birds succumbed to extinction. There have since been many other high profile examples of the mesopredator release across a wide-range of taxa, spanning Europe [@elmhagen2007trophic], Africa [@gorman1998high], Australia [@johnson2007rarity] and in many marine systems [@baum2009cascading]. Grounded in traditional-food web ecological theory, the mesopredator release hypothesis (hereafter 'MRH') is a simple and intuitive hypothesis. So why, 33 years later, does the MRH remain one of the most contentious hypotheses in applied ecology? 

Firstly, there is a lack of replicated, robust evidence for the MRH. This is partly because predators are difficult to monitor, particularly with experimental designs. The average predator is cryptic and occurs widely across broad landscapes, at low densities. To obtain sufficient sample sizes for statistical models, a very large area needs to be surveyed intensively [@royle2008statistical]. There often aren't similar landscapes without apex predator declines to compare with, at least ones which are spatially independent [e.g. @dexter2009impact]. Without robust experimental designs, it is difficult to attribute changes in mesopredator populations to apex predator declines [@hayward2015ecologists]. 

Secondly, the MRH remains a blurry concept because of a reliance on vague population metrics. Top predators may suppress mesopredators through direct killing, resource competition and fear-induced behavioural changes [@ritchie2009predator]. Mesopredator release was originally defined as a numerical increase in abundance, but has since been expanded to include changes in mesopredator distribution and behaviour following apex predator decline [@prugh2009rise]. Many of the North American field studies reviewed by @jachowski2020identifying provided mixed support for MRH because different population metrics provided conflicting inference. @jachowski2020identifying called for clearer separation of spatial, numerical and behavioural processes, which are wrapped together in commonly used "abundance" indices [@stephens2015management]. It is particularly important to account for changes in detectability because a relaxation of mesopredator behaviour may falsely signal an increase in abundance. There are few examples of mesopredator release which with direct estimates of population density; these studies have mostly used live capture-rates to infer population density, without accounting for behavioural changes which may have made individuals more trappable [e.g. @arjo2007changes; @karki2007effects; @thompson2007food; @berger2008indirect; @jones2008sudden]. These traditional survey and statistical methods also have an ill-defined spatial resolution; this is problematic because sampling scale impacts the direction of perceived species interactions [@guillaume2020co-occurrence; @efford2012occupancy].  

Thirdly, the MRH can be an overly simplistic representation of complex ecosystems. Most evidence for mesopredator release comes from North America and other regions with many co-occurring large carnivores [@ritchie2009predator]. MRH refers to a singular, direct negative association between a dominant predator and a subordinate species, overlooking the complex webs of positive, negative, direct, indirect and probably nonlinear interactions which occur in multipredator systems [@levi2012wolves; @prugh2020enemies; @finke2004predator; @johnson2007rarity]. Additionally, bottom-up processes (i.e., ecosystem productivity and prey availability) can interact with top-down processes to determine the strength of mesopredator release and when/if it occurs at all [@elmhagen2007trophic; @greenville2014bottom]. Intensive multispecies monitoring and complex statistical methods are therefore required to disentangle mesopredator release from the background drivers of predator populations, but this has rarely taken place. A simpler alternative is to test the MRH in ecosystems with a predator niche comprised of only two species. 

We lack key detail on the conditions which drive the occurrence and strength of mesopredator release which hinders effective conservation management. The functioning of global ecosystems has been degraded by widespread declines in top predators [@ripple2014status; @heithaus2008predicting]. Managers therefore need to predict outcomes of continued predator declines [@estes2011trophic], as well as improvements [@chapron2014recovery] and reintroductions [@baker2017ensemble]. While may native predators have undergone severe decline in recent times, some predators have spread far beyond their native ranges and become a leading cause of global biodiversity and economic declines [@bellard2016global; @doherty2016invasive]. Accordingly, lethal control of invasive predators is a prevalent management strategy worldwide. However, when multiple invasive species occur, single invasive species control can often backfire and worsen outcomes for native species [@ballari2016potential]. This is most likely due to release subordinate invasive species [e.g. @rayner2007spatial]. A better understanding of the interactions between invasive predators is key to improving conservation outcomes [@zavaleta2001viewing; @doherty2017stop]. 

Debate over the MRH rages in Australia--a continent which has 'institutionalised' poisoning predators [@philip2019institutionalisation]. The dingo *Canis familiaris* is Australia's native mammalian apex predator and is widely persecuted, mainly for agricultural benefits [@smith2015dingo]. This is expected to have caused a mesopredator release of the introduced red fox *Vulpes vulpes* (hereafter 'fox') and feral cat *Felis catus* (hereafter 'cat'), in turn contributing to Australia ongoing extinction crisis [@johnson2007rarity; @newsome2017top; @woinarski2015ongoing; @woinarski2019reading]. The MRH considers a predator guild comprising of two species, but what happens following apex predator decline when there are multiple subordinate species? Literature covering the dingo-debate hypothesises both foxes and cats can benefit from dingo decline. Alternative theory predicts an among-carnivore cascade [@levi2012wolves]: in a dingo (~15 kg) - fox (~6 kg) - cat (~4 kg) hierarchy, dingo suppression would benefit foxes, which would in-turn disadvantage cats. Competition between these introduced predators should be high; foxes and cats occupy a similar niche [@glen2005complex] with high dietary overlap [@stobo2021reptiles; @stobo2021sharing]. Although, evidence that foxes exert top-down pressure on cats is unclear [@hunter2018not]. 

Strongest evidence of fox-cat interactions comes from targeted lethal fox control programs in southern parts of Australia where the medium-large carnivore guild comprises entirely of these two predators. Foxes are managed primarily for biodiversity conservation in protected areas, although few programs have demonstrated improvements and several long-term studies have reported perverse outcomes on native biodiversity [@wayne2017recoveries; @marlow2015cats; @lindenmayer2018conservation; @duncan2020eruptive; @dexter2009impact; @kinnear2016fox]. A mesopredator release of cats is commonly suspected to be the cause, although, @duncan2020eruptive offers an alternative hypothesis regarding prey overshooting carrying capacities. Indeed, cat activity appears to increase on average following targeted fox control, but this estimate is uncertain [@hunter2018not]. Notably, @molsher2017mesopredator observed no change in the 'abundance' of cats, but observed changes in diet and space use following fox control. No study has directly estimated feral cat density in response to fox control. Distinguishing numerical population change from behavioural changes is a clear priority to improve understanding of fox-cat interactions and mesopredator release in Australia. 

My thesis aims to test the MRH using experimental designs replicated across two regions--examining the MRH from several different angles. I firstly investigated whether apex predator control effort was correlated with an increase in the occurrence of a mesopredator (Chapter 3). I secondly estimated direct changes in mesopredator density following apex predator suppression using traditional experimental designs, while accounting for changes in detectability (Chapter 4). I thirdly investigated how apex predators influenced the spatiotemporal behaviour of mesopredator through a 'landscape of fear' [@laundre2001wolves] in Chapter 5. In accordance with the MRH, I hypothesised that top predator control would increase the occurrence, density and alter the behaviour of the mesopredator. These chapters highlight the different ways in which mesopredator release can manifest and how different population metrics provide different inferences on the MRH. 

I tested the MRH in simple predator guilds comprising of the introduced fox and cat. I experimentally surveyed landscapes with and without lethal fox control (1080 poison-baiting). This allowed a sharp focus on the interactions between the two invasive predators--how cats respond to artificial gradients of apex predator activity--as well as the resulting impacts on two threatened native prey species. Much of our current understanding of the basic ecology and impacts of invasive predator in Australia comes from semi-arid and arid regions; my research provides some of the first investigations of population dynamics and interactions within temperate forest ecosystems. My thesis also investigates bottom-up drivers of invasive predator and threatened native mammal occurrence, including the effect of fire across different vegetation communities, rainfall patterns and habitat fragmentation. I hope this research sheds light on optimal methods for surveillance and management of invasive predators for the benefit native species in temperate, heterogeneous landscapes.

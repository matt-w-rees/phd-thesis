# General Introduction 

## Mesopredator release hypothesis 

"In the absence of large predators, smaller predators can become more abundant (mesopredator release) and, in turn, may cause the local extinction of vulnerable prey species." - @soule1988reconstructed. 
 
Against a backdrop of growing evidence that subordinate predator species ‘undergo population explosions’ in the absence of dominant predators, @soule1988reconstructed first coined the term 'mesopredator release'. @soule1988reconstructed found that where coyotes *Canis latrans* were absent in California, U.S.A, domestic cats *Felis catus* were more prevalent and populations of native birds succumbed to extinction. There have since been many other high-profile examples of the mesopredator release across a wide range of taxa, spanning Europe [@elmhagen2007trophic], Africa [@gorman1998high], Australia [@johnson2007rarity] and in many marine systems [@baum2009cascading]. Grounded in traditional-food web ecological theory, the mesopredator release hypothesis (hereafter 'MRH') is a simple and intuitive hypothesis. So why, 34 years later, does the MRH remain highly contentious [e.g., @gehrt2003raccoons; @allen2017can; @allen2011wild; @nimmo2015dingoes]?
 
Firstly, there is a lack of replicated, robust evidence for the MRH for many ecosystems. This is partly because it is often difficult to obtain sufficient data to quantify changes in subordinate predator behaviour and density, particularly within an experimental design [@glen2007evaluating; @ford2015trophic]. Predators are typically elusive and occur widely across broad landscapes, at low densities. Hence very large areas may need to be surveyed intensively to obtain sufficient sample sizes [@royle2008statistical]. Furthermore, spatially-independent but otherwise similar landscapes without top predator declines can be difficult to find [e.g., @dexter2009impact]. Without robust experimental designs, it is difficult to attribute changes in mesopredator populations to apex predator declines [@hayward2015ecologists; @treves2019predator; @claridge2013examining]. 
 
Secondly, evidence for the MRH often relies on ill-defined population metrics. Dominant predators can suppress subordinate predators through direct killing, resource competition as well as fear-induced behavioural changes [@ritchie2009predator]. Mesopredator release was originally defined as a numerical increase in subordinate predator population density following apex predator decline [@soule1988reconstructed], but has since been expanded to also include changes in distribution and behaviour [@brashares2010ecological]. Many of the North American field studies reviewed by @jachowski2020identifying provided mixed support for MRH because different population metrics provided conflicting inference. @jachowski2020identifying called for clearer separation of spatial, numerical and behavioural processes, which are often wrapped together in commonly used "abundance" indices [@stephens2015management; @anderson2001need]. It is particularly important to account for changes in subordinate predator detectability when testing mesopredator release, because a relaxation of subordinate predator behaviour may be falsely interpreted as an increase in density. The few examples of mesopredator release that have directly estimated changes in mesopredator population density (rather than rely on an index) have mostly used live capture-rates to infer mesopredator population density [e.g., @arjo2007changes; @karki2007effects; @thompson2007food; @berger2008indirect; @jones2008sudden]. This approach still fails to account for behavioural changes which may have, for example, made individuals more trappable. Moreover, these traditional survey and statistical methods have an ill-defined spatial extent which can be problematic when estimating population densities of wide-ranging predators [@efford2004density]. 
 
Thirdly, the MRH can be an overly simplistic representation of complex ecosystems [@haswell2017large]. Most evidence for mesopredator release comes from North America and other regions with many co-occurring apex predators [@ritchie2009predator]. MRH refers to a singular, direct negative association between a dominant and a subordinate predator species, overlooking the complex webs of positive, negative, direct, indirect and probably nonlinear interactions which occur in multi-predator systems [@levi2012wolves; @prugh2020enemies; @finke2004predator; @johnson2007rarity]. Additionally, bottom-up processes (such as ecosystem productivity and prey availability) can interact with top-down processes to determine the prevalence and strength of mesopredator release [@elmhagen2007trophic; @greenville2014bottom; @oksanen2000logic]. In these circumstances, intensive multispecies monitoring and sophisticated statistical analyses are likely to be required to distinguish mesopredator release from the background drivers of predator populations [e.g., @sivy2017fatal], but this has rarely taken place [@jachowski2020identifying]. 
 
In the context of the MRH, the dominant predator species is often referred to as an ‘apex’ or ‘top’ predator, and subordinate species as ‘meso-’ or ‘middle-rank’ predators. This can be confusing because a particular species may function as a dominant predator in one system or context, and a subordinate predator in another. For example, in the classic Californian MRH example, coyotes *Canis latrans* are described as an apex predator as they are the largest carnivore present [@crooks1999mesopredator]; however, coyotes evolved as mesopredators in systems with larger carnivores, such as wolves *Canis lupus* [e.g., @berger2008indirect]. @wallach2015apex argues that the term apex predator should be reserved for predators that self-regulate their own population densities, by limiting their reproductive and recruitment rates, and exhibit cooperative and territorial behaviours. These tend to be large species above 13 – 16 kg [@wallach2015apex]. Meanwhile, @wallach2015apex define mesopredators as predators that are regulated by extrinsic factors (top-down and bottom-up control) and have fast reproductive rates. These species tend to be smaller, generalists and more susceptible to mesopredator release, responding quickly to the removal of top-down control [@wallach2015apex; @prugh2009rise]. Mesopredators may even exploit the available prey more thoroughly than apex predators following release, as their honed behaviours allow them to use resources efficiently while under persecution. Hence mesopredators often thrive in human-dominated landscapes and become successful invasive species in locations outside their natural distribution [where they may be the largest predator present, @prugh2009rise; @vance2007influence; @holt1997theoretical]. However, for consistency with the MRH literature, I will refer in this thesis to the dominant predator of a particular ecosystem as the apex predator, and subordinate species as a mesopredator.
 
A lack of understanding of the conditions that lead to mesopredator release hinders effective conservation management. Around the world, the functioning of ecosystems has been degraded by apex predator declines [@ripple2014status; @heithaus2008predicting]. Managers need to be able to predict outcomes of continued apex predator declines [@estes2011trophic], as well as improvements [@chapron2014recovery] and reintroductions [@baker2017ensemble]. Simultaneously, some mesopredators have spread far beyond their native range [@wallach2015novel]; these ‘invasive’ predators are a leading cause of global biodiversity and economic decline [@bellard2016global; @doherty2016invasive], particularly if they are the dominant predator in the new ecosystem. Accordingly, lethal control of invasive predators is a prevalent management strategy worldwide. However, when a system is invaded by multiple predator species, controlling a single invasive predator species can backfire and worsen outcomes for native species [@ballari2016potential; @doherty2017stop]. This is most likely due to the release of subordinate invasive species [e.g., @rayner2007spatial]. A better understanding of the interactions between invasive predator species is key to improving conservation outcomes [@zavaleta2001viewing]. 
 
Debate over the MRH rages in Australia&mdash;a continent that has 'institutionalised' poisoning of predators [@philip2019institutionalisation]. The dingo *Canis familiaris* is Australia's native mammalian apex predator and widely persecuted, mainly for purported agricultural benefits [@smith2015dingo]. This is thought to have promoted the spread and increased the density of two invasive mesopredators, the red fox *Vulpes vulpes* (hereafter 'fox') and feral cat (hereafter 'cat'), in turn contributing to Australia’s ongoing extinction crisis [@wallach2010predator; @johnson2007rarity; @newsome2017top; @woinarski2015ongoing]. Literature covering the dingo-debate hypothesises that both foxes and cats can benefit from dingo decline, however, alternative theory predicts an among-carnivore cascade [@levi2012wolves]: in a dingo (~15 kg) - fox (~6 kg) - cat (~4 kg) hierarchy, dingo suppression would benefit foxes and consequently disadvantage cats. Competition between these invasive predators should be high: foxes and cats occupy a similar niche with high dietary overlap [@glen2005complex; @stobo2021reptiles; @stobo2021sharing; @woinarski2021compounding]&mdash;likely to promote high levels interspecific aggression and killing [@donadio2006diet].
 
Evidence that foxes exert top-down pressure on cats in Australia is mixed. The strongest evidence comes from targeted lethal fox control programs in southern Australia. In these regions, dingoes are often absent and so the medium-large mammalian carnivore guild comprises only these two invasive mesopredators. Here, the larger fox is expected to fill the role of an apex predator, with the cat being subordinate [@glen2005complex]. In these regions, foxes are also widely managed for biodiversity conservation within protected areas; however, few fox management programs have demonstrated improvements in native biodiversity and several long-term studies have reported perverse outcomes [@wayne2017recoveries; @marlow2015cats; @lindenmayer2018conservation; @duncan2020eruptive; @dexter2009impact; @kinnear2016fox]. Mesopredator release of cats is commonly suspected to be the cause [although, @duncan2020eruptive offers an alternative hypothesis regarding prey overshooting carrying capacities]. The @risbey2000impacts exclusion experiment offers a compelling case study: shared prey abundance declined in a landscape with targeted fox control, but prey trajectories improved in a landscape where both foxes and cats were controlled, relative to a landscape without any predator management.
 
On average, cat activity (i.e., abundance indices) is estimated to increase following targeted fox control, but this estimate is highly uncertain [@hunter2018not], and fails to distinguish changes in cat behaviour from changes in cat density. Notably, @molsher2017mesopredator found no difference in the relative abundance of cats (spotlight counts) but observed changes in cat diet (increased invertebrate and carrion consumption) and space use (smaller home ranges and increased foraging in relatively open habitats) following fox control. Changes in feral cat density in response to fox control have not been directly estimated. Distinguishing numerical population change from behavioural changes is a clear priority for improving the understanding of fox-cat interactions, mesopredator release and invasive predator management approaches in Australia [@hayward2015ecologists]. 
 
My thesis aims to examine the mesopredator release of cats following fox control from several different angles, using experimental designs replicated across two regions of south-eastern Australia. I firstly investigated whether apex predator control effort was associated with an increase in the occupancy rates of a mesopredator (Chapter \@ref(occ)). I secondly estimated direct changes in mesopredator density following apex predator suppression using replicated experimental designs, while accounting for changes in detectability (Chapter \@ref(density)). In accordance with the MRH, I expected that lethal control of foxes would increase the density and detectability of cats, as well as decrease movement distances [as found by @molsher2017mesopredator]. In doing so, I also derived the first estimates of cat density for wet forest environments (Chapter \@ref(otways17)). I thirdly investigated how top predator activity influenced the spatiotemporal activity of a mesopredator, predicting cat activity would be lower at sites with high fox activity and shift diel activity patterns away from those of foxes (Chapter \@ref(diel)). These chapters highlight the different ways in which mesopredator release can manifest and how different population metrics provide different inferences on the MRH. 
 
Testing the MRH in a simple predator guild comprising the invasive fox and cat (Fig. \@ref(fig:intro-conceptual)), and experimentally surveying landscapes with and without lethal fox control (1080 poison-baiting) allowed a sharp focus on the interactions between these two invasive predators across experimental gradients of top predator activity [@kreyling2018replicate; @ford2015trophic], without the complicating effect of having a genuine apex predator (dingo) in the system. It also facilitated some examination of the resulting impacts on two threatened native prey species (Fig. \@ref(fig:intro-conceptual)), and an investigation of the bottom-up drivers of invasive predator and threatened native mammal occurrence, including the effect of fire across different vegetation types, rainfall patterns and habitat fragmentation (Chapter \@ref(occ)). 
 
My thesis sheds light on optimal methods for monitoring and managing invasive predators for the benefit native fauna in temperate, heterogeneous landscapes. Much of our current understanding of the ecology and impacts of invasive predators in Australia comes from semi-arid and arid regions [@legge2017enumerating; @doherty2015critical]; my research provides some of the first investigations of invasive predator density, distributions and interactions within temperate forest ecosystems, particularly wet and cool temperate rainforests. Experimental invasive predator studies in these environments have been previously called for [e.g., @glen2005complex; @doherty2015critical; @legge2017enumerating; @hayward2015ecologists]. 


## Study species
 
My thesis focuses on interactions between two invasive predators, the red fox and feral cat (Fig. \@ref(fig:intro-conceptual)). Foxes and cats in Australia share a similar functional niche and compete for many of the same resources [@glen2005complex]. Chapter \@ref(occ) also investigates the impact of fox control on two of their shared native mammalian prey species, the southern brown bandicoot (hereafter 'SBB') *Isodon obesulus* and long-nosed potoroo (hereafter 'LNP') *Potorous tridactylus* (Fig. \@ref(fig:intro-conceptual)). These native marsupials are both solitary, medium-sized, ground-dwellings, and listed as threatened under federal legislation (*Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999*). They are also flagship species for the Ark fox-baiting programs that formed the experiments for this thesis and ideal prey species to test the MRH, as their body size makes them highly susceptible to both fox and cat predation [@stobo2021sharing]. SBBs and LNPs nest in dense understorey vegetation during the day and turn over large quantities of soil to feed on invertebrates, plant material and fungi at night–key behaviours which sustain ecosystem function [@nuske2017redundancy; @fleming2014loss]. More species-specific ecological information is provided below. 
 
### Red fox 
Introduced to Australia in the early 1870s, European red foxes (~6 kg) are now ubiquitous across the Australian mainland except for tropical areas to the north [@fairfax2019dispersal]. Foxes can be highly territorial [@cavallini1996variation]. They live in family groups comprising a dominant pair and their juvenile cubs [@cavallini1996variation]. In productive areas, fox territories are smaller, more rigidly defended and adult offspring are more likely to remain with the group and help the dominant vixen raise cubs - resulting in higher population densities [@cavallini1996variation]. Foxes are classically considered mesopredators [@wallach2015apex], particularly because many of these behaviours break down in highly productive agricultural environments and urban areas, reaching high population densities (> 4 foxes km^-2^). However, foxes can have many apex predator-like self-regulating behaviours, as characterised by [@wallach2015apex] including reproductive limitation, infanticide, alloparental care and strong territoriality [@moehlman1997cooperative; @baker2004polygynandry; @braastad1993maternal]. Foxes follow seasonal behavioural patterns: mating occurs in winter, cubs are born in spring (average litter sizes being 3 to 6 cubs), and dispersal occurs in autumn [@hradsky2019foxnet]. Foxes are omnivorous and true generalists; taking advantage of all available prey and frequently scavenge carcasses [@fleming2021diet], making them easy targets of poison-baiting campaigns [@mcleod2014fertility]. Notable differences from the diet of cats include small livestock, large macropods and fruits [@stobo2021sharing; @stobo2021reptiles; @woinarski2021compounding].

Foxes in Australia are primarily managed through 1080 (sodium fluroacetate) poison-baiting [@saunders2010impacts]. Levels of fox suppression vary widely across conservation management programs; ranging from substantial [@berry2014slow; @thomson2000effectiveness; @moseby2011use] to small [@bengsen2014effects; @newsome2014rapid] reductions in fox activity, as well as increases [@towerton2016control; @towerton2011detecting]. This is most likely due to variation in the spatial and temporal intensity of lethal control [@saunders2007improving], as well as compensatory increases in fox dispersal and litter size [@lieury2015compensatory; @gentle2007poisoning; @marlow2016compensatory]. The poison 1080 degrades in the environment over time and so there are also concerns that sublethal doses of poison may promote bait-averse fox populations [@allsop2017reduced]. Historically, the response of foxes to lethal control has often gone unmonitored [@reddiex2007control], despite being fundamental to understanding the responses of cats and native prey.

### Feral cat 
The feral cat (~4 kg) is one of the most adaptable and widely distributed terrestrial mammalian predators. It took less than a century for cats to spread across the entire Australian continent following colonisation, owing to their wide thermal tolerance and non-reliance on free-standing drinking water [@abbott2008spread]. Cats are largely solitary across Australia’s typical natural environments, although they can form dense matrilineal societies in areas with rich resources [e.g., farms, rubbish tips, seabird colonies, @denny2002social]. Densities in more natural Australian environments range from 0.01 to 1.5 cats km^-2^ [@legge2017enumerating; @hamer2021differing]. Female cat home range size scales negatively with landscape productivity [@bengsen2016feral], from less than 100 ha to more than 600 ha [@hamer2021differing]. Male cat home range size varies with that of females, but is larger on average because dominant males typically overlap the ranges of two to three females [@bengsen2016feral]. Home ranges often overlap [@glen2005complex] and some individuals do not have a fixed home range [@roshier2021space]. Feral cats can breed several times a year with litters of up to five kittens [@jones1982ecology2]. Feral cats are obligate carnivores, they prefer live prey but occasionally scavenge [@doherty2015continental]. They do not readily take most types of meat bait, particularly in temperate regions with abundant prey [@fisher2015cat]. Feral cats are indeed archetypal mesopredators. 
 
### Southern brown bandicoot
The 'SBB' (~1.2 kg) *Isodon obesulus* occurs in isolated populations across the southern coast of the Australia mainland and in Tasmania, mostly found in heathy landscapes, woodlands and dry forests [@van2008mammals]. SBBs are solitary, with home range size varying from 0.5 - 6 ha [@lobert1990home]. Females have remarkable reproductive rates: a gestation period of 11 days, producing two - three litters per breeding season (six month duration), averaging two to four young, who become independent after 60 days [@brown2010national]. Estimates of mainland SBB density average approximately 130 individuals km^-2^ [@pentland1999population].
 
### Long-nosed potoroo 
The LNP (~1.3 kg) *Potorous tridactylus* has a patchy distribution down the eastern coast of Australia from south-eastern Queensland to south-eastern South Australia; it also occurs throughout the north and east coasts of Tasmania [@van2008mammals]. LNPs occupy a wide range of vegetation communities, from heathlands to rainforests [@van2008mammals]. Females give birth to a single young up to four times a year, and provide each with ~133 days of lactation in the pouch [@frankham2011population]. In south-west Victoria, LNPs have a home range size of 1.4 - 2 ha [@bennett1987conservation]. LNP populations are generally small, at densities of 20 - 60 individuals km^-2^, with low rates of juvenile recruitment and individual turnover [@mason1998habitat; @frankham2011population].

# Fire and poison-baiting manipulate invasive predator and threatened prey occurence within temperate landscapes {#occ}

## Abstract {-}

## Introduction

Species are dying. 
non-conservation focused Land management actions often have negative consequences for native species, important to identify how we can minimise this. Conservation dollars are extremely limited, so it is important to ensure actions are cost-effective. However limited monitoring which provides causal inference on human actions.    

Australia has the worlds worst mammal extinction records. 
Largely due to habitat clearing, altered fire and invasive species. More recently recognising climate as a driver too.

## Methods


### Study area
(Copied from diel activity draft)
We collated camera-trap data from two distinct regions in south-west Victoria, Australia (Fig. 1). The terrestrial mammalian predator guild is depauperate here. Dingoes *Canis familiaris* are now absent throughout, as is the the tiger quoll *Dasyurus maculatus*, more recently absent in the Otway Ranges (last sighted in 2014 despite extensive camera-trapping). Introduced red foxes and feral cat are therefore the only medium-large functional mammalian terrestrial predators across both regions. Across broad sections of each region, government land managers conduct ongoing targeted fox control for biodiversity conservation - poison baits containing 3 mg of sodium mono-fluroacetate (1080) are buried at a depth of 10 cm at 1-km intervals along accessible forest tracks and roads. The purpose of each  collated camera-trap study was to to experimentally survey changes in the mammalian community due to fox control, and so, our study covers a wide range contexts with and without fox-baiting. 

In the Glenelg region, Gunditjmara country, natural vegetation has been highly fragmented. Here, camera-survey sites were situated in six distinct forest blocks; two of which separated by a river, others separated by mostly pastoral farming and residential property). Foxes in three forests blocks have been subject to lethal control since October 2005, with 1080 poison-baits replaced fortnightly [@ROBLEY2014262]. 

The Otway Ranges, Gadubanud and XX country, is a largely continuous patch of natural vegetation with a strong east-west rainfall and elevation gradient [@swan2021species]. Foxes are controlled through 1080 poison-baits with monthly replacement across most of the Otway Ranges (a large section to the north-west remains unbaited). The majority of this baiting began in 2016 - 2017, although fox-baiting commenced in some small sections in 2008. 

Alongside fragmentation, the extremely rugged, wet forest and rainforest matrix in the western Otway Ranges is the main difference between the two regions. Prescribed fire, primarily for the purpose of asset protection, is another key management action undertaken throughout both regions (except in very wet sections of Otway Ranges). 

 
### Camera-trap surveys
(Copied from diel activity draft)
We compiled camera-trap data from three distinct studies across the two regions. After removing camera-traps which were operational for less than 14 days, this totalled 3659 deployments of camera-traps at 1232 camera-trap sites. Survey durations ranged between 14 and 93 days (mean 47), totalling 171,966 trapnights. Camera-trap spacing was variable; the average minimum distance between simultaneously deployed camera-traps was 445, 853 and 1266 metres for each study. Camera-trap were deployed in the Glenelg region between 2013 – 2019, whereas in the Otway Ranges surveys were conducted in 2016 – 2019. 

All camera-trap deployments consisted of a Reconyx (Holmen, Wisconsin) brand camera-trap (both white and infrared flashes), attached to a tree or a metal picket, facing a lure. Camera-traps were set-up in two ways depending on the key aim of the project, either targeted toward predators or prey species. One study across both regions positioned camera-traps lower on a tree (around 15 - 30 cm above the ground – angled only slightly downwards) facing a tuna oil lure approximately 2 - 2.5 m away [detailed in @REES2019108287]. The remaining camera-traps were positioned higher on a tree or a metal picket (at least 40 cm above ground) and angled downwards more strongly - facing a lure approximately 1 - 1.5 m away. These lures consisted of peanut butter, golden syrup and rolled oats were mixed into a small ball, placed within a tea strainer or PVC pipe container and secured either to the ground, or 20 - 60 cm above ground on a wooden stake. All set-ups were effective in detecting both predator and prey species.  

### Cumulative detection probabilities
Copied from Brons paper:

"We did not incorporate imperfect detection in the BN models. As an indicator of survey efficacy for each species, however, we calculated the probability that each species would be detected at least once during the survey period given that it was present as xx where p is the overall detectability estimate for the species. We calculated p for each species by fitting the single season occupancy model of MacKenzie et al. (2002) using the unmarked package (Fiske and Chandler 2011) in R version 3.2.3 (R Core Team 2015)."

### Generalised additive models of species occurence   
We constructed a table with a row for each camera-trap deployment, a presence-absence column for each of the four study species, as well as additional columns for site information and explanatory variable values. We modelled occurrence probability for each species (response variable) using binomial generalised additive mixed-effects models (hereafter 'GAMMs') implemented in the 'mgcv' R-package [@wood2017]. We specified a model offset to account for differences in camera-trap survey durations and a random intercept for each unique site to account for repeat sampling. We used the same model structure for each species, because we expected all explanatory variables to impact occurrence probabilities, and we aimed to contrast responses. We used REML estimation and allowed all non-categorical explanatory variables (detailed below) to be non-linear -- setting the maximum wiggliness and allowing complexity to be removed using REML estimation. We used the double penalty model selection approach, which penalises the null space in addition to the range space (i.e. shrinking wiggly terms to linear terms) of the spline basis, meaning covariate effects can be entirely removed from the model [@MARRA20112372].

We expected the density of 1080 poison-baits (targeted to foxes) to decrease the fox occurrence probability, and therefore increase the occurrence probability of three subordinate species. We summed the number of fox-baits within a 2.3 km radius around each camera-trap deployment - the average maximum distance foxes in these region travel from their home range centre [@hradsky2017human]. We modelled this explanatory variable using a thin plate regression spline, with a factor smooth basis to model the impact separately for each region (sharing information on wiggliness). Poison-baits are replaced at different frequencies (fortnightly v.s monthly) across the regions, which has been occurring over different time scales (~7-13, 0-3 years) in the Glenelg region and Otway Ranges (respectively). 

Food and shelter levels differ both across and within vegetation types - mediated by fire [@MCCOLLGAUSDEN2019243]. We expect species occurrences to differ across vegetation types and with time since fire, but to have slightly different responses to time since fire in each different vegetation type. We specified these explanatory variables with a hierarchical term which estimated a an average time since fire response ('global smoother'), long with group-level smoothers with shared wiggliness for each EVC group [i.e. model GS in @pedersen2019hierarchical]. This model structure shares information across groups, but penalises functions which deviate strongly from the average response--increasing confidence that they are true deviations opposed to the result of sampling noise. We used coarse fire scar mapping provided by government managers to calculate the years since the last fire for each camera-trap deployment. Ecological Vegetation Classes (hereafter 'EVC') are the standard units for classification in Victoria, Australia [@delwp2020]. We attached EVC groupings for each unique camera-trap site, 8 EVC groups in total. We surveyed 20 unique sites in rainforests, which are interspersed (primarily in low lying gullies) throughout wet and damp forests in the south-eastern Otway Ranges. Given the finescale interspersion of these EVC groups, and that rarely or never experience fire, we merged them together (hereafter referred to as 'wet forests'). 

Long-term climate is a strong driver of species distribution in the Otway Ranges [@swan2021species], as are short-term rainfall fluctuations in another region of south-western Victoria [@https://doi.org/10.1111/ddi.12471]. We expect short-term rainfall fluctuations to have different impacts across the wide spatial gradient of average rainfall in our study sites (i.e. a 10% reduction in rainfall should have a greater impact in heathland than rainforests). We therefore modelled a tensor product interaction term for spatial annual average rainfall and short-term temporal dynamics in actual rainfall. We extracted annual rainfall values (mm) from the NARCLiM dataset (1-km resolution)[BCCVL database]("https://app.bccvl.org.au/datasets?iframe#c12=modified&reversed=on&b_start=0&c2=4816d016b9af4fb18f6cc8b2f1f979dc"). To calculate percentage different in short-term rainfall, we downloaded all available rainfall data from proximal weather stations (n = XX) from [Queensland Government and the Australian Bureau of Meteorology]("https://www.longpaddock.qld.gov.au/silo/point-data/"). For each species detection, we took the amount of rainfall in the previous 18 months at the nearest weather station, as well as the median rainfall over that same 18 month period since rainfall began being recorded at that weather station, and calculated the percentage difference between those two values. We chose 18 months for a comparison to @https://doi.org/10.1111/ddi.12471). 

Mammals may also be driven by wetness at a finer scale - e.g. surface water. We therefore included a smooth of the average topographic wetness index within a XX radius around each camera-trap site, with a thin plate regression spline basis. The topographic wetness index is a quantification of topographic influences on hydrological processes and is calculated using the upslope catchment area and angle of slope in each pixel (Liu et al. 2013). We extracted this values the 30-m resolution shapefile from the [CSIRO database]("https://data.csiro.au/dap/landingpage?pid=csiro%3A5588"). 

Invasive predators are well-documented to prefer edges between forest and cleared land (refs). Mammalian prey species are also likely impacted by edges indirectly due to increased invasive predators occurrence probability, and directly due to lower level of proximal suitable habitat (refs). We inverted the Victoria native vegetation extent shapefile from [DELWP]("https://discover.data.vic.gov.au/dataset/native-vegetation-modelled-2005-ecological-vegetation-classes-with-bioregional-conservation-sta"), and removed non-native vegetation areas which were smaller than 30 ha (which Hradsky ref?). For each camera-trap site, we calculated the minimum distance to non-native vegetation area. We used a thin plate regression spline for this smooth.

## Discussion




Assumed perfect detection. Fine for prey species, but predators not so much. Not a big deal because we were less interested in prediction and more in causation. 

Causation. Trade-off between the number of correlated variables and inference gleaned. Assumed independence between EVC and rainfall --> structural equation models and bayesian networks allow this, although, would not allow non-linear / error propagation.

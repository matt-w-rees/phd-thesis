# Synthesis 

Does fox control cause mesopredator release of feral cats? This was the central question of my thesis, which I investigated from several different angles. So how do my findings from different population metrics and statistical methods fit together? What should land managers do with this information? And what are the priorities for future research?


## Weighing up the evidence for mesopredator release 

**The classic definition of the mesopredator release hypothesis (hereafter ‘MRH’) is that an apex predator population decline leads to an increase in the density of mesopredators [@soule1988reconstructed], but few studies have tested or demonstrated this**. This is partly due to the difficulty of estimating predator density robustly. By using recently developed spatially explicit capture-recapture methods which allowed for flexible detection rates [@efford2004density], my thesis provides the first evidence that fox control can increase the density of cats. High cat densities were consistently associated with fox control and cat density was negatively associated with fine-scale fox occurrence (Chapter \@ref(density)). 

The strongest evidence of mesopredator release in terms of population density came from the Glenelg region (Chapter \@ref(density)). Fox control in the Glenelg region had occurred for more than a decade, having a strong suppressive effect on fox occupancy (Chapter \@ref(occ)). Cat density increased to a smaller extent following fox control commencement in the Otway Ranges, unsurprising given fox control had only recently commenced with less consistent bait replacements. The impact of fox control on cats--ranging from no effect to a nearly four-fold increase in cat density--depended on the degree of fox suppression (Chapter \@ref(density)). We confirmed this with regressions between cat density and fox occupancy estimates at fine spatial scales (Fig. \@ref(fig:dcor)). Visual inspection of raw estimates suggest cats may respond more closely to foxes at the landscape level--testing predator interactions at different spatial scales would assist in designing future MRH studies [@sivy2017fatal]. It is reassuring that fox control was never associated with an estimated decline in cat density (although, 95% confidence intervals indicates this was possible in some replicates).

While our study provides evidence for the MRH in terms of population density, there are several key limitations. In the Glenelg region, we cannot be sure that feral cat density was not already higher in these landscapes prior to fox control commencing (because there is no available data). I overcame this limitation by using a Before-After-Control-Impact-Paired-Series (BACIPS) design in the western Otway Ranges. However, there was some overlapping of confidence intervals for cat density estimates between treatments in the Otway Ranges experiment, and no spatial replication of the BACIPS design which increasing the vulnerability to type 1 error [i.e., falsely inferring there was an effect of fox control on cats; @conquest2000analysis]. 

It would be easy to recommend that managers of new fox control programs conduct spatially replicated, randomised, BACIPS spatial capture-recapture surveys over longer time periods to quantify potential mesopredator release of cats, but difficult to imagine the resources being available to do so. To address the most time-consuming part of this process, collaborators and I have been trialling machine learning methods to automatically identify species and individual cats from camera-trap images; these show promise and are likely to increase the feasibility of such studies by management agencies. Still, reliable estimates from spatial mark-resight models require large sample sizes, which was difficult to obtain for one of the highest density populations of cats on the Australian mainland (Chapter \@ref(otways17)). For lower density cat populations, sufficient sample sizes may be more feasibly achieved using clustered spacing of camera-trap over larger areas rather than the grid designs we used [@clark2019comparing; @sun2014trap]. A key benefit of spatial capture-recapture studies is that differences in study designs can be accounted for, allowing feral cat density estimates to be collated across different landscapes, regions and fox control programs to improve our understanding of fox-cat interactions. This will be particularly important to uncover how different management regimes and landscape contexts impact the strength and occurrence of mesopredator release. 

**Recently, the definition of the MRH has been expanded to also capture changes in mesopredator distribution and behaviour following apex predator decline [@brashares2010ecological]**. I was able to explore these angles using density (Chapter \@ref(density)), occupancy (Chapter \@ref(occ)) and spatiotemporal activity (Chapter \@ref(diel)) models. While changes in cat density in response to fox control were consistent across replicates and regions, changes in cat behaviour and detectability were relatively inconsistent. 

The impact of foxes on cat detectability was more reliably observed in the Otway Ranges than the Glenelg region. In the Glenelg region, there was little evidence that cat spatial detection rates changed with fox control or across fox occurrence probability gradients (Chapter \@ref(density)). In the Otway Ranges, spatial capture-recapture models revealed that cats did not range as far and were more detectable in their activity centre when fox occurrence was low (Fig. \@ref(fig:detcor)); the occupancy-detection model estimated cats to be slightly more detectable with fox control (Fig. \@ref(fig:occ-det)a). We also found evidence suggesting cats used behavioural avoidance strategies at low fox occupancy probabilities in the Otway Ranges, which was replaced by reductions in population densities at high fox occurrence probabilities (Fig. \@ref(fig:detcor); Fig. \@ref(fig:dcor). This could explain the lack of avoidance behaviours observed in the Glenelg region, as average fox occurrence probabilities in landscapes with fox control were comparable to the western Otways prior to fox control (Fig. \@ref(fig:foxplot)). There is growing recognition of the impact nonconsumptive predator effects can have on ecosystems, a better understanding of what can drive the occurrence and strength of predator avoidance behaviours will be key to accurately predicting the outcomes of predator management [@wirsing2021context; @preisser2005scared].

Differences in landscape context also likely mediate antipredator strategies [@lima1990behavioral]. Responses vary because of differences in shelter and prey availability, as well as predator density and ecology [@lima1999temporal; @wirsing2021context]. This was highlighted in Chapter \@ref(diel), which suggested cats avoid foxes in time by becoming more diurnal in dry vegetation types, and more nocturnal in wet forests (Fig. \@ref(fig:diel-cat-fox)). These complexities make it difficult to hypothesise how mesopredators will respond to apex predator declines in terms of behaviour--a concern given studies increasingly use behaviour and predator co-occurrences to infer mesopredator release [@jachowski2020identifying]. These results demonstrate the importance of comparing responses across a range of contexts, as well as separating out changes in density from behaviour where possible to better understand how mesopredator release manifests. 

**Like many mesopredator release studies that have been conducted using multiple methods across several landscapes [@jachowski2020identifying], I found conflicting inference around predator interactions and the MRH**. The aims of my PhD thesis were similar to those of @molsher1999ecology, who also found fox control to impact cats in some ways, but not others. Both @molsher1999ecology and I found no evidence that fox control increases cat activity indices and evidence that cats may reduce ranging distance following fox control. Coupling telemetry and diet analyses, @molsher1999ecology also found cats to increase their use of more open habitat types and consumed more carrion and invertebrates following fox control [@molsher2017mesopredator]. Mesopredator release can manifest in different ways, it is therefore important not to judge mesopredator release on one metric or approach alone.

In my thesis, the most commonly used methods - occurrence models, activity indices, circular overlap in diel patterns (although we did not explicitly test this) - inferred little-no impact of foxes or fox control on cats. Nonetheless, feral cat density increased with fox control (Chapter \@ref(density)) and cats shifted diel activity patterns in response to fox activity (Fig. \@ref(fig:diel-cat-fox)). There are likely to be several reasons (which I have discussed throughout my chapters) why a higher density of cats did not lead to more sites clearly occupied (Chapter \@ref(occ)), and more cat detections (Chapter \@ref(diel)), such as changes in behaviour impacting detection rates and facilitating spatial coexistence. Taken together, my results caution the use of simplistic indices to infer density and averaging species responses across broad, heterogeneous regions, and highlight the importance of accounting for changes in detectability when testing the mesopredator release hypothesis. 

**A key source of contention around the MRH is the use of associative rather than causal inference [e.g., @allen2013clear]**. I used traditional experimental designs as well as (linear and nonlinear) regression methods to test the MRH. Both approaches provided causal inference because foxes were artificially manipulated and fox control was not confounded with other variables (for example, some control programs target effort where predator or prey activity is highest, or only control foxes seasonally). Binary treatments (e.g., fox control) are considered the gold standard in experimental design, but are often imperfect in large scale ecological in-site experiments [@kimmel2021causal]. Testing responses across experimental gradients (e.g., fox occurrence) may be more reliable in certain circumstances, such as when responses are nonlinear [@kreyling2018replicate]. I found this to be particularly useful in the Otway Ranges where fox control effort was inconsistent; simplifying fox control into a binary treatment variable overlooked important nuances (e.g., bait density and replacement schedules), which were somewhat irrelevant when fitting a regression between estimated cat density and fox occurrence probabilities. However, the line between causal and associative inference was blurry given I averaged landscapes where foxes were and weren't controlled. Fitting separate regressions to test if inference were consistent across replicates would have been more informative (however I opted against this in my thesis to reduce complexity). Traditional experimental designs are often called for in testing the MRH [e.g., @glen2007evaluating; @hayward2015ecologists], but are not the only means to provide robust causative inference--a range of experimental approaches can provide complementary inference on management interventions [@kimmel2021causal]. 

**Because we did not compare associations between cats and foxes relative to prey species, we cannot distinguish whether mesopredator release was a result of top-down suppressive or indirect competitive effects**. This is difficult to tease apart, particularly considering direct and indirect mesopredator suppression are both expected to be stronger when intraguild competition is high [particularly in depauperate predator guilds; @brashares2010ecological; @prugh2009rise; @prugh2020enemies. We did find evidence for direct top-down suppressive effects of foxes on cats through negative correlations between finescale cat density and fox occurrence. Evidence for competitor release would require a negative association between foxes and prey, but would a positive or negative association with cats and prey signal competitor release? A positive association could infer cats track the prey, or be interpreted as coexistence. We currently have a poor understanding of how prey availability impacts cat density [@legge2017enumerating], particularly in temperate regions relative to the arid and semiarid [e.g., @greenville2014top].

My thesis provides evidence that foxes can constrain the population density and temporal activity patterns of feral cats in temperate, meeting the definitions of mesopredator release [@jachowski2020identifying; @prugh2009rise; @brashares2010ecological]. We found signs of other behavioural changes, such as differences in movement and detection rates, but these were observed relatively inconsistently. Predicting behavioural changes in mesopredator behaviour following apex predator decline will be a key challenge for future research. Advancing the MRH will require surveying mesopredator responses a range of landscape contexts, with the use of different experimental and analytical methods. 

My thesis provides evidence that fox control can cause a mesopredator release of feral cats, a  result which should encourage integrated invasive predator control. However, where simultaneous or staggered control of foxes and cats is not feasible, managers need to weigh up the benefits of reducing fox predation against potentially increasing cat predation of vulnerable fauna to accurately assess the net benefit of fox control for biodiversity conservation.


## Does a mesopredator release of feral cats matter?

Based on cat density estimates [@legge2017enumerating] and diet analyses, Australian feral cats are estimated to kill 1.4 billion native Australian animals each year [@woinarski2017birds; @woinarski2018reptiles; @murphy2019introduced]. However, predation rates of particular species may not necessarily increase with cat population density. This is because predation rate depends on cat demographics [@moseby2015catastrophic], individual specialisation [@dickman2015individual], as well as predator and prey behaviour [@abrams1993predation] and microhabitat context [@mcgregor2015feral]. Only a small number of cats are required to inflict large damage to local populations [@tuft2021cats; @greenwell2019cat; @moseby2019understanding].

Cats have been implicated in the extinction of many Australian species, most notably in northern Australia [where foxes are absent; @woinarski2015ongoing; @davies2018declining; @stobo2020bottom]. However, cat densities in northern Australia are low [@legge2017enumerating; @davies2021variation; @mcgregor2017habitat; @stokeld2016experimental]. The prevailing hypothesis to explain this is that fire and large herbivore grazing have reduced understorey habitat structure, thereby increasing cat predation rates [@ziembicki2015stemming]. However, perhaps feral cats did reach unsustainably high densities in northern Australia, enabled by the once-abundant fauna populations and lack of suppression from foxes, leading to prey population crashes and subsequently their own. The possibility of this boom-bust cat-prey dynamic is a concern for the Otway Ranges, where cat density is among the highest in Australia (Chapter 2) and small mammal species have declined in recent times [@wayne2017falling; @lock2017influence; @menkhorst2006background; @wilson2020patterns; @wilson2017decline]. There is extremely limited information on temporal trends in cat densities, my three-year study in the Otway Ranges offers an important baseline for future comparison. Understanding how cat density fluctuates over time and how this relates to prey populations is a priority for future research. 

 Behavioural traits are likely strong drivers of predation, although more difficult to understand relative to predator density [@abrams1993predation]. 

The primary aim of this thesis was to understand whether mesopredator release occurring rather than its implications for native fauna. Nonetheless, fox control has now been shown to alter the density, diel activity patterns, movement-rates, habitat preferences and diets of cats [@molsher2017mesopredator]. It is therefore plausible to expect that fox control will increase the impact of feral cats, but also potentially also shift impacts onto different species or individuals which have previously had less exposure cat predation. Furthermore, I was able to examine the responses of two shared native prey. These potential impacts of a mesopredator release may explain why southern brown bandicoots showed no increase in sites occupied following fox control. However, long-nosed potoroos have strongly benefited from fox control in the Glenelg region (but not the Otway Ranges).  

Some native prey, particularly larger species, are more more susceptible to foxes than cats [@stobo2021reptiles; @stobo2021sharing; @woinarski2021compounding]. For example, a density of 0.03 foxes km^-2^ drove a reintroduced population of burrowing bettongs *Bettongia lesueur* to extinction within 12 months, but another population persisted with no foxes and up to 0.46 cats km^-2^ [@moseby2019understanding]. There is not statistical evidence that prey weight on which species benefit from fox control, although species such as rodents and small dasyurids have been far less often monitored [@hunter2018not], and are most likely to be impacted from a mesopredator release of cats. For example, bush rats *Rattus fuscipes* have been reported as receiving no benefit [@banks1999predation] as well as becoming locally extinct following fox control [@wayne2017recoveries]. Further, prey can be driven by both bottom-up and top-down effects and the relative importance of these processes can vary geographical and temporally, making it difficult to predict how changes in predator populations will impact prey [@meserve2003thirteen; @sinclair2002complex; @sinclair1998predicting; @oksanen2000logic]. More work is needed to examine the responses of different prey species to fox control, particularly smaller species which are more likely sensitive to cat predation.

Threats can act in synergy. If fox control leads to both a release of cats and herbivores, this could reduce habitat structure which would increasing vulnerability of prey to cats and any surviving foxes. There is concern that large macropods (kangaroos and wallabies) may become overabundant following fox control (as foxes are their primary terrestrial predators where dingoes are absent), thereby increasing their grazing pressure which could reduce the habitat structure smaller prey species require to shelter in [@doherty2017stop]. There is some evidence for this [@banks2000predation, @dexter2013unintended]. Additionally, there is concern in the Glenelg region that an increase in common brush-tailed possums has potentially excluded threatened native prey from sites (such as tree hollows). However, @geary2020predators modelled the effect of fox control of medium-large herbivore with the Glenelg Ark dataset and found no effect of fox control on herbivore occurrence. Nonetheless, herbivore release could still manifest from changes in herbivore density, recruitment rates and behaviour, therefore worth further investigation. 

These factors make it difficult to predict what impact a mesopredator release of feral cats will have on native prey of concern. Even with mesopredator release of feral cats, fox control has value as a conservation action [@hunter2018not]. However, fox control programs are rarely monitored in ways which can reliably detect which species are responding positive, neutrally or negatively to fox control. I hope my thesis does not discourage the use of targeted fox control but encourages the careful monitoring of feral cats and a wider range of shared prey taxa (particularly species that might be highly vulnerable to cats). If cat density increases considerably, or particularly species show signs of decline, lethal cat control should be integrated [e.g., @comer2020integrating]. Indirect predator management [e.g. rabbit control] or more targeted species-specific conservation actions [e.g. tailored fire management] could also be employed. In dire situations, fox control could be ceased, however this would lose the earlier value of fox control – and fox control needs to be sustained over the longer-term.

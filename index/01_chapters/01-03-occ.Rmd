# Fire and lethal fox control manipulate the occurrence of invasive predators and threatened native prey {#occ}

## Abstract {-}

Invasive predators, habitat fragmentation as well as altered fire regimes and rainfall dynamics are key biodiversity threats which often overlap across space. However, disentangling the impacts of multiple stressors and identifying the effectiveness of management is challenging when species occur patchily throughout heterogeneous landscapes.

Here we assessed the effects of the lethal control of an introduced apex predator, the red fox *Vulpes vulpes*, on mammal communities in fire-prone and fragmented forests of south-eastern Australia. Our study, that synthesises and reanalyses data from multiple smaller scale studies, combined experimental and space-for-time approaches, with one-off and repeat deployments of 3667 camera-traps at 1232 sites. We used occupancy-detection models as well as generalised additive models to account for potentially nonlinear effects of multiple drivers and management actions on the occupancy of two invasive mammalian predators and two threatened native prey at survey locations.

In one system with frequent, long-term (8 - 13 years) poison-baiting, foxes were heavily suppressed in terms of both detectability and occupancy. This improved the occupancy of long-nosed potoroo *Potorous tridactylus* considerably, but had little-no effect on the southern brown bandicoot *Isodon obesulus*. This may have been because there was some evidence that feral cat *Felis catus* occupancy was slightly higher in landscapes with fox control (signalling mesopredator release), or because southern brown bandicoot occupancy was more strongly driven by the long-term effects of fire. In another system where fox control recently commenced (0 - 2 years), foxes were suppressed to a lesser extent; no impacts were yet detected on subordinate species. 

Both predator control and prescribed fire are important tools land managers can use to manipulate mammalian communities. However, the effectiveness of lethal predator management depends on control effort (here poison-bait density) and optimal fire regimes need to be tailored to vegetation type. Our study highlights the importance of long-term, multispecies monitoring for managed systems.

## Introduction

Accurate and precise estimates of the effects of management are essential to inform decision-making, ensure cost-effective allocation of resources and identify potential unintended consequences of interventions [@christie2020poor]. However, reliable inference about the effects of landscape-scale management is often difficult to achieve because populations fluctuate naturally (e.g., with rainfall) and with often multiple co-occurring threats and management actions [@pressey2007conservation; @sugihara2012detecting]. This is particularly the case for species which are distributed broadly across heterogeneous landscapes, but occur patchily throughout [@tulloch2016using]. Another challenge is identifying the cause of nil or perverse outcomes.

Invasive predator management is a classic example. Predators can have devastating impacts on native biodiversity when introduced beyond their native range, and so, are often actively controlled using lethal methods [@bellard2016global; @doherty2016invasive; @sih2010predator]. Quantifying the degree of invasive predator suppression, the responses of their native prey and any unintended outcomes across gradients of predator control is key to designing effective, cost-efficient management programs [@walsh2012unexpected; @baxter2008cost]. However, the ability of associated monitoring programs to detect these signals is often limited by confounding from by co-occurring threats, management actions or natural drivers. This is concerning because few or negative effects on native biodiversity are often observed following invasive predator control, particularly when multiple introduced species are present [@ballari2016potential].

There are several explanations for why native fauna may not benefit from introduced predator control. Firstly, invasive predators may not be suppressed below tolerable thresholds--predators can be remarkably resilient to low-effort culling [@sabo2005stochasticity; @sinclair1998predicting; @moseby2019understanding; @lazenby2015effects]. Secondly, predation by introduced species may not be the primary limit on native prey populations [@banks1999predation]. Thirdly, invasive predator suppression may lead to a 'release' of a subordinate predator [@crooks1999mesopredator; @courchamp1999cats] or competitor species [@ruscoe2011unexpected], which could potentially worsen outcomes [e.g., @rayner2007spatial]. Quantifying apex predator suppression and testing the mesopredator release hypothesis [@prugh2009rise], particularly across gradients of lethal control effort [@cattarino2016accounting], are important steps towards an understanding of prey responses to lethal predator control. 

Quantifying impact of planned fire on fauna is similarly complex. Fire can drive the persistence and abundance of fauna populations, primarily through its effects of vegetation structure [@monamy2000small]. These effects persist for decades or centuries, are nonlinear, and vary across environmental conditions [@haslem2011habitat]. Because post-fire regeneration of habitat structure varies across ecological communities, fauna species can have variable responses to time since fire across heterogeneous landscapes [@swan2015predicting; @nimmo2014why]. This has been relatively well-documented for prey species who are dependent on habitat structure for shelter, however long-term effects of fire on predators are unclear [@geary2020predator]. Predicting long-term ramifications of fire on predators and prey is a key challenge for managers who are tasked with stemming the decline of native fauna populations while simultaneously protecting against the increasing threat of large wildfires [@clarke2008catering]. 

Disentangling the complex and potentially interacting effects of invasive predator and fire management is particularly pertinent to Australia, which has experienced some of the worst biodiversity declines in recent world history [@woinarski2019reading; @waldron2017reductions]. Predation by introduced species and altered fire regimes are clearly primary drivers [@woinarski2015ongoing], but other threatening processes such as habitat fragmentation, and natural drivers such vegetation type and rainfall dynamics also play an important role in determining the contemporary distribution of native fauna [@may1996influence; @hale2016fire]. Lethal red fox *Vulpes vulpes* (hereafter ‘fox’) control and prescribed burning (primarily for asset protection) are among the most common management actions performed in protected areas, however, we have a poor understanding of effects on native fauna [@lindenmayer2018conservation; @mcleod2008control; @clarke2008catering; @hradsky2020conserving; @braysher2017managing]. This is partly because there is strong spatial overlap of these threats and management actions [@evans2011spatial] and potential unintended consequences often go unmeasured. A mesopredator release of feral cats *Felis catus* (hereafter ‘cat’) following fox control is a primary concern, albeit based on limited evidence [@comer2020integrating; @marlow2015lethal; @doherty2017stop; @hunter2018not; @risbey2000impacts; @wayne2017recoveries]. There is also growing body of evidence that invasive predators impacts are heightened in recently burnt areas [@hradsky2017human; @hradsky2017responses; @mcgregor2014landscape; @leahy2016amplified; @green2006immediate; @meek2000home; @mcgregor2016extraterritorial], although we have a poor understanding of whether this effect lasts over a long-term [@hradsky2020conserving]. 

In this study we assessed the effects of two landscape-scale lethal management programs for foxes in fire-prone regions of south-eastern Australia. We quantified the effects of management on foxes (the managed species), cats (unmanaged competitor), and two threatened species that are the primary focus of the conservation programs – the southern brown bandicoot *Isodon obesulus* (hereafter 'SBB') and long-nosed potoroo (hereafter 'LNP') *Potorous tridactylus*. Our study combined experimental and space-for-time approaches, with one-off and repeat deployments of 3667 camera-traps at 1232 sites around one long-term (foxes had been continuously controlled for 8 - 13 years in approximately half of this surveyed region) and one recently commenced (monitored 1 year prior and 2 years following fox control which occurs in approximately 75% of the surveyed region) fox control programs in protected conservation areas. We first modelled species detection and occupancy probabilities in response to fox control across each region with occupancy-detection models [@mackenzie2002estimating]. We then modelled species occupancy using Generalised Additive Models (hereafter 'GAMs'), which did not account for imperfect detection, but allowed nonlinear responses and more complex variable interactions. We used GAMs to model the potentially nonlinear responses of species occupancy to fox control effort (1080 poison-bait density), time since fire (0 - 89 years) across each vegetation community, rainfall dynamics and proximity to cleared areas.

## Methods

### Study area and camera-trapping 
In this study we reanalysed data from multiple smaller scale camera-trap studies across two regions in south-west Victoria, Australia: the Glenelg region and Otway Ranges (Fig. \@ref(fig:occ-map)). Introduced foxes and cats are the only medium-large functional mammalian terrestrial predators here: native dingoes *Canis familiaris* are long-absent throughout, tiger quolls *Dasyurus maculatus* are long-absent in the Glenelg region and likely functionally extinct in the Otway Ranges (last confirmed sighting in 2014). In broad sections of each region, government land managers conduct ongoing targeted fox control for biodiversity conservation. Poison-baits containing 3 mg of sodium mono-fluroacetate ('1080') are buried at a depth of 12 - 15 cm at 1-km intervals along accessible forest tracks and roads. Different road densities result in spatially variable poison-bait densities. Managers also frequently implement prescribed fire across both regions. 

#### Glenelg region
In the Glenelg region, Gunditjmara country, large patches of natural vegetation are fragmented by pastoral farming and residential properties (Fig. \@ref(fig:occ-map)). Foxes have been subject to poison-baiting in three distinct forest blocks since October 2005, with fortnightly bait replacements [@robley2014long]. These forest blocks, along with three similar, unbaited forest blocks to the north are simultaneously surveyed annually under the 'Glenelg Ark' fox control program [40 camera-sites per block; @robley2020glenelg]. Hair-tubes were used to monitor prey species from 2005 - 2013 [presented in @robley2014long], replaced by camera-traps from 2013 onwards [here we present camera-trap data from 2013 - 2019; @robley2020glenelg]. We also included a further 425 camera-trap deployments from early 2018 (M.W.R PhD surveys). This totals 2039 camera-trap deployments in the Glenelg region, collected in a control-impact experimental design (foxes had been continuously controlled for at 8 - 13 years in the treatment landscapes by the time of these surveys). 

#### Otway Ranges
The Otway Ranges, Gadubanud, Kirrae Wurrung, Gulidjan and Wadawurrung country, is a largely continuous patch of natural vegetation with a strong east-west rainfall gradient (Fig. \@ref(fig:occ-map)). A matrix of cool temperate rainforest and wet forest occurs at high-altitudes in the south-west descend into a large heathland directly north, and into dry forests and then heathlands to the north-east.  Fox-baiting commenced in small sections in 2008 and large-scale systematic baiting began in 2016 - 2017 under the 'Otway Ark' program [@robley2019otway]. For the first six weeks poison-baits replaced weekly, then changing to monthly bait-replacement. There was an approximate six month pause in bait replacement during the second half of 2018. Fox control recommenced with four weeks of fortnightly bait-replacement, before returning to monthly bait-replacement. A large section to the north-west remains unbaited, but is monitored as an experimental non-treatment site [@robley2019otway]. Otway Ark managers survey 372 camera-trap sites annually (not simultaneously); we present one 'before' survey and two 'after' surveys of each site from 2016 - 2018, totalling 1113 camera-trap deployments [@robley2019otway]. An also include data from an additional before-after control-impact survey (one 'before' survey and two 'after') in the western section of the Otway Ranges annually from 2017 - 2019 (M.W.R PhD surveys). This added a further 195 sites and 524 camera-trap deployments. 

#### Camera-trap set-ups
All camera-trap deployments consisted of a Reconyx (Holmen, Wisconsin) brand camera-trap (white or infrared flash), attached to a tree or a metal picket, facing a lure. One study across both regions (M.W.R PhD surveys) positioned camera-traps lower on a tree (around 15 - 30 cm above the ground – angled only slightly downwards) facing a tuna oil lure approximately 2 - 2.5 m away [detailed in @rees2019unexpectedly]. The Glenelg Ark and Otway Ark fox monitoring programs positioned camera-traps higher on a tree or a metal picket (at least 40 cm above ground) and angled more strongly downwards toward a lure approximately 1 - 1.5 m away [@robley2020glenelg; @robley2019otway]. These lures consisted of peanut butter, golden syrup and rolled oats mixed into a small ball, placed within a tea strainer or PVC pipe container and secured either to the ground, or 20 - 60 cm above ground on a wooden stake. All set-ups were effective in detecting all four target species.

#### Study species
We examined occupancy probabilities of two invasive predators and two shared native mammalian prey species listed as threatened under federal legislation (EPBC Act 1999). The introduced predators share a similar functional niche similar and compete for many of the same resources [@glen2005complex]. Both prey species are solitary, medium-sized, ground-dwelling marsupials. They nest in dense understorey vegetation during the day and turn over large quantities of soil to feed on invertebrates, plant material and fungi at night [@van2008mammals]. 

### Occupancy-detection models
We first modelled species occupancy probabilities using occupancy-detection models [@mackenzie2002estimating] implemented in a Bayesian framework using 'stan' [@carpenter2017stan] via the 'ubms' R-package [@ubms]. For each species, we fit a 'stacked' single-season model: repeat surveys were considered as additional sites and pseudoreplication accounted for by using a random-intercept for each unique site. We used a 24-hour survey occasion and modelled the effect of fox control on species occupancy and detectability separately across each region (i.e., an interaction between region [Glenelg or Otway] and fox control treatment [baited or unbaited]). We fit models with four MCMC chains with 10,000 iterations per chain (including a 5000 iteration warm-up). To determine whether or not detection probabilities for these surveys were high enough to move to presence-absence generalised additive models (which do not account for imperfect detections), we calculated cumulative detection probabilities for camera-trap survey lengths [@garrard2008when] from one to 93 days (maximum survey duration).


### Generalised additive models 
The occupancy-detection models revealed high cumulative detection probabilities based on our average camera-trap survey effort for each species (except for cats in the Glenelg region). This justifies the assumption of (near) perfect detection required for utilising binomial generalised additive models (GAMs) to analyse variation in occupancy of prey species as a function of environmental and management covariates. The use of GAMS has the added advantage of allowing modelling of non-parametric, nonlinear relationships between occupancy and explanatory variables. We modelled species occupancy probabilities using binomial GAMs implemented in the ‘mgcv’ R-package [@wood2017generalized]. These models assumed perfect detection, but allowed more complex model structures to be fit in a computationally efficient framework.  

Our GAMs used a binary occupied-unoccupied response variable for each entire camera-trap deployment. To account for differences in camera-trap survey durations, we specified a model offset for log-transformed survey length, as well as a random effect for each unique camera-site to account for repeat sampling. We used the double penalty model selection approach, which penalises the null space in addition to the range space (i.e., shrinking wiggly terms to linear terms) of the spline basis, meaning explanatory variables can be entirely removed from the model if not supported by the data [@marra2011practical]. We used the same model structure and explanatory variables, detailed in the sections below, for each species.

#### 1080 poison-bait density
1080 poison-baits are deployed to suppress foxes and therefore benefit native prey, and perhaps also cats as they are subordinate competitors to foxes. Fox suppression is a function of the spatial arrangement (i.e., poison-baiting density) relative to fox home-range size, as well as the replacement schedule of 1080 baits [@fleming1996ground; @benshemesh2020citizen]. We therefore summed the number of poison-bait stations within a 2.3 km radius around each camera-trap deployment - the average maximum distance foxes travel from their home-range centre across these regions [@hradsky2017human]. Densities ranged from 0 - 19 baits per fox home-range across both regions (mean: 10 and eight baits per fox home-range in fox-baited landscapes in the Glenelg region and Otway Ranges, respectively). For an easier comparison to other studies, we then divided fox-baits by 16.1 to get the number of baits per square kilometre. We modelled a smooth (potentially nonlinear) function of 1080 poison-bait density with a thin plate regression spline (the default) and a factor smooth for seperate responses per region. In certain weather conditions, some poison-bait stations become inaccessible and baits do not get replaced, but we did not account for this because we lacked this information. There was also an approximate six month pause in bait replacements in the Otway Ranges we did not account for - assuming a bait density of zero during this time would have ignored prior fox suppression and there were likely baits still present in the landscape. 

#### Time since fire and vegetation type 
We modelled an interaction between TSF and vegetation type as we expected species occupancy to differ across vegetation types and with time since fire (in years; hereafter 'TSF'), and to have variable responses to TSF in each vegetation type [as post-fire regeneration occurs at different speeds; @swan2015predicting]. We used coarse fire scar mapping provided by government managers and calculated years since the last fire for each camera-trap deployment. We identified the Ecological Vegetation Class group [hereafter 'vegetation type'; standard units for vegetation classification in Victoria; @delwp2020] for each unique camera-trap site, totalling 8 vegetation types. We only surveyed 20 unique sites in rainforests, which are interspersed (primarily in low lying gullies) throughout wet and damp forests in the south-eastern Otway Ranges. Given the similarity, fine-scale interspersion of these EVC groups, and that both rarely or never experience fire, we merged them together (hereafter referred to as 'wet forests'). We specified this interaction with a hierarchical model structure, which estimated an average TSF response (i.e., 'global smoother'), along with separate responses to TSF in each vegetation type (i.e., group-level smoothers) [model GS detailed in @pedersen2019hierarchical]. This shares information on TSF responses and wiggliness across EVC groups, penalising functions which deviate strongly from the average response and do not have the data to back it up. 

#### Recent rainfall
Changes in short-term rainfall dynamics likely impact both invasive predator and native prey species [@greenville2014bottom; @wilson2012terrestrial; @paull2013fragmentation; @arthur2012relative]. We therefore calculated the percentage difference in rainfall from the long-term median that had occurred prior to start of each camera-trap survey in six, 12, 18 and 24 month periods. We used rainfall data from the nearest weather station [n = 11; @BOM2021] of each camera-trap. We modelled rainfall using a thin plate regression spline and a factor smooth basis for each region. For each species, we fit a separate model for each time period and compared them using Akaike Information Criterion (hereafter 'AIC') scores [@burnham2004multimodel]. 

#### Proximity to forest edge 
Invasive predators are well-documented to prefer edges between forest and cleared land as they facilitate efficient movement and hunting [@hradsky2017human; @nichols2019evaluation; @may1996influence]. We therefore included a smooth term of the minimum distance from each camera-trap site to the nearest area of non-native vegetation area using a thin plate regression spline. We calculated this by inverting the extent of native vegetation [@NV2005_EVCBCS] and removing cleared areas smaller than 30 ha [@geary2020predators].

All analyses were conducted in R version 3.6.3 [@R].

## Results

### Red fox
Foxes were detected on 1453 of the 3667 camera-traps (Table \@ref(tab:occ-naive)). Fox detectability was high, particularly in the Glenelg region (Fig. \@ref(fig:occ-det)a) where 95% detection probability was reached after a 30 day survey duration (relative to 64 days in the Otway Ranges; Fig. \@ref(fig:occ-cumdet)). Fox control reduced fox detectability, by 69% in the Glenelg region (relative to unbaited landscapes) and 24% in the Otway Ranges (Fig. \@ref(fig:occ-det)a). Foxes in baited landscapes still had a high detection probability for the average survey duration (47 days) - 76% in the Glenelg region and 81% in the Otway Ranges (Fig. \@ref(fig:occ-cumdet)). 

The occupancy-detection models estimated fox occupancy to be 48% lower in Glenelg region landscapes with fox control relative to the unbaited landscapes (Fig. \@ref(fig:occ-det)b). Suppression of foxes was less dramatic (22% reduction in occupancy) in the Otway Ranges with considerable overlap in credible intervals (Fig. \@ref(fig:occ-det)b). The GAM showed fox occupancy to scale negatively with fox-bait density across both regions (Fig. \@ref(fig:gams-occ-main)). This was a near-linear function in the Otway Ranges but nonlinear in the Glenelg region: 0.4 baits km^-2^ was just as effective at suppressing fox occupancy as 0.5 - 0.8 baits km^-2^ in the Glenelg region (suppression picked up again at higher bait densities).

Foxes were ubiquitous across the study regions, but occupancy was high in dry forests, herb-rich woodlands and lowland forests relative to heathlands, heathy woodlands and wet forests (Fig. \@ref(fig:occ-det)c). On average, foxes declined linearly with TSF (Fig. \@ref(fig:gams-occ-main)), with minor variation in this response across vegetation types, with the exception of lowland forests where occupancy peaked approximately 40 years post-fire (Fig. \@ref(fig:occ-tsf)). Foxes were most likely to occupy sites adjacent to non-native vegetation, and strongly declined with increasing distance for up to approximately 1.5 km (Fig. \@ref(fig:gams-occ-main)).

The fox GAM which considered rainfall deviations in the previous 18 months was ranked highest (by at least 2.9 AIC units) relative to models with six, 12, and 24 month periods (Table. \@ref(tab:occ-rain-aic). In the Glenelg region, occupancy was highest when rainfall was lowest, as well as in the mid-range of above average rainfall, however, the opposite pattern was found in the Otway Ranges (Fig. \@ref(fig:occ-rainfall)). The fox GAM had an adjusted R-square value of 0.28 and explained 28% of the null deviance. 
  

### Feral cat
Cats were detected on 1010 camera-trap deployments (Table \@ref(tab:occ-naive)). Cats were the least detectable of our study species, particularly in the Glenelg region where they had a 59% detection probability for the average survey duration (relative to 83% in the Otway Ranges; Fig. \@ref(fig:occ-cumdet)). Cat detectability was slightly higher with fox control in the Otway Ranges; but there was no difference between fox control treatment in the Otway Ranges (Fig. \@ref(fig:occ-det)a). The occupancy-detection models estimated cat occupancy to be 60% higher in landscapes with fox control relative to those without in the Glenelg region (Fig. \@ref(fig:occ-det)b), with no effect in the Otway Ranges (Fig. \@ref(fig:gams-occ-main)).

Cat occupancy was most strongly driven by vegetation type, as well as rainfall in the Glenelg region only (Fig. \@ref(fig:gams-occ-main)). Cat occupancy was by far highest in the wet forest, followed by heathland, swampy scrub, herb-rich woodland, dry forest, lowland forest and lastly heathy woodland (Fig. \@ref(fig:occ-det)c). Cat occupancy in herb-rich woodland peaked around 50 years after fire (Fig. \@ref(fig:occ-tsf)). Cats had no average TSF response (the global smooth was also removed from the model) and weak, uncertain responses to TSF in all other vegetation types (Fig. \@ref(fig:gams-occ-main)). Cats decreased linearly with distance from areas of non-native vegetation, however, this response was weak with relatively high uncertainty (Fig. \@ref(fig:gams-occ-main)).

There was strong evidence that the GAM which considered rainfall deviations in the previous six months performed better (at least 17.5 AIC units lower) than models with longer time periods (Table. \@ref(tab:occ-rain-aic)). Like foxes, cat occupancy in the Glenelg region was highest when rainfall was lowest, as well as in the mid-range of above average rainfall (Fig. \@ref(fig:occ-rainfall)). Rainfall had a very weak effect on cats in the Otway Ranges. The cat GAM had an adjusted R-square value of 0.25 and explained 26% of the null deviance.  


### Southern brown bandicoot
We detected SBB's on 394 of the 3667 camera-traps (Table \@ref(tab:occ-naive)). A greater than 95% detection probability was reached after 31 and 43 days for SBB's in the Glenelg and Otway Ranges, respectively (Fig. \@ref(fig:occ-cumdet)). SBB's were slightly less detectable in baited landscapes relative to the unbaited landscapes of the Glenelg region, and slightly more detectable with fox control in the Otway Ranges. There was no discernible effect of fox control on SBB occupancy, a very slight increase and decrease with high uncertainty in the Glenelg region and Otway Ranges, respectively (Fig. \@ref(fig:occ-det)b; Fig. \@ref(fig:gams-occ-main)).

Fire was a strong and complex driver of SBB occupancy, on average peaking 20 and 75 years post-fire (Fig. \@ref(fig:gams-occ-main)). Deviations from the average TSF response in vegetation type only differed in an overall linear increase or decrease with TSF (with high uncertainty) rather than changing the shape of the response (Fig. \@ref(fig:gams-occ-main)). Occupancy probability for SBB's was highest in heathy woodlands (Fig. \@ref(fig:occ-det)c) and they were largely absent from the wet forests (Table \@ref(tab:occ-naive)). The few SBB detections in wet forest occurred adjacent to other vegetation types (SBB's are largely replaced by long-nosed bandicoots *Perameles nasuta* in wet forest). A strong, but highly uncertain response to distance to non-native vegetation was observed - SBB occupancy was highest approximately 2.5 km from areas of native vegetation (Fig. \@ref(fig:gams-occ-main)). The top-ranked model in terms of AIC scores had the effect of rainfall completely removed (Table. \@ref(tab:occ-rain-aic)). The SBB GAM had an adjusted R-square value of 0.38 and explained 44% of the null deviance.  


### Long-nosed potoroo
We detected LNP's on 331 camera-trap deployments (Table \@ref(tab:occ-naive)). LNP's were the most detectable of our study species, reaching a 95% detection probability from a 33 and 18 day survey  duration in the unbaited landscapes of the Glenelg and Otway regions, respectively (Fig. \@ref(fig:occ-cumdet)). In the Glenelg region, LNP detectability was 88% higher in landscapes with fox control relative to those without (Fig. \@ref(fig:occ-det)a). LNP occupancy increased linearly up to 7-fold across the entire fox-bait density gradient in the Glenelg region (Fig. \@ref(fig:gams-occ-main)).

Occupancy of LNP's was highest in heathlands (Fig. \@ref(fig:occ-det)c). On average, LNP's increased linearly with TSF (Fig. \@ref(fig:gams-occ-main)), particularly in heathy woodlands (Fig. \@ref(fig:occ-tsf). However, occupancy was estimated to decline with TSF herb-rich woodlands (although uncertainty around this response was high; Fig. \@ref(fig:occ-tsf). The rainfall term was removed for the three top-ranked models (all indistinguishable based on AIC scores). Occupancy of LNP's was higher further away from edges of non-native vegetation (Fig. \@ref(fig:gams-occ-main)). The LNP GAM had an adjusted R-square value of 0.51 and explained 56% of the null deviance.

## Discussion

Here we found effective invasive predator suppression and threatened prey conservation to be a function of sustained and intensive control effort. The Glenelg Ark program has continuously controlled foxes across approximately 100 000 ha of public land since 2005 [@robley2014long] and is one of the few fox control programs to demonstrate a sustained reduction in fox occupancy [see also @stobo2020management]. A reduction in fox occupancy is a strong sign of management effectiveness because it means prey are less exposed to the threat of predation by foxes. Fox detectability was also considerably lower in the baited landscapes relative to  unbaited landscapes, corroborating other studies which have found intensive fox control to suppress fox activity [e.g., refs]. The main caveat of these results is that predator responses to fox control can only be inferred by comparing baited landscapes to similar landscapes which are unbaited in the Glenelg region -  we have no information on predators prior to fox control commencing [only prey were monitored prior to fox control using hair-tubes; @robley2014long]. Fox control in the Glenelg region appears to be strongly benefiting one threatened prey species (long-nosed potoroo) but is currently offering little improvement to another species (southern brown bandicoot) with similar traits.

The Otway Ark program commenced fox-baiting across 85,000 ha of the Otway Ranges in November 2017. Fox control has been more inconsistent than the Glenelg region, (mostly monthly bait-replacements with an approximately six month pause during mid-late 2018). Here we saw a slight decrease in fox detectability and signs that fox occupancy decreased due to fox control, although this occupancy effect was small with high uncertainty. Neither focal prey species showed signs of improvement, although this effect was averaged over a 0 - 2 year time period [but does support the findings of @robley2019otway, who estimated occupancy per year using a more traditional BACI analysis with a subset of this data]. Despite the high fecundity of these prey species, two years was likely insufficient time to measure an effect of fox control on prey occupancy, particularly considering the relatively weak fox suppression so observed far. Fortunately, the ongoing broadscale monitoring of the Otway Ark fox control program will shed light on temporal trends in site-occupancy.

We slightly underestimated the effect of bait density in the Glenelg region because we assumed all bait-stations were constantly active, despite some bait-replacements being missed due to accessibility issues following wet weather events or because of more pressing management concerns (e.g. fire). We more strongly underestimated the effect of bait density in the Otway Ranges because we also did not account for the near six month pause in bait replacement. We also expect fox-baits to be less effective in the Otway Ranges than the Glenelg region due to the high average rainfall which more quickly degrades the poison [@gentle2007persistence; @saunders2000degradation]. Nevertheless, fox occupancy in the Otway Ranges was still a negative associated with fox-bait density, suggesting that more sustained fox control here is likely to be effective. Future research will benefit from accounting for the role of environmental conditions and prey availability on baiting effectiveness [@carter2013fox; @saunders2007improving], as well as interference with baits from non-target species [@glen2003monitoring; @fairbridge2000observations; @marlow2015lethal].

Our study provides empirical evidence that the effectiveness of poison-baiting fox control program depends on the densities of poison-bait deployed. This has been inferred by comparing programs across different regions (where fox ecology, environmental conditions and study designs differ), but few previous studies have measured fox suppression across gradients of poison-bait densities. Ours differs from @benshemesh2020citizen and @walsh2012unexpected in that we tested fox occupancy (rather than using scats counts an an activity index), measured bait densities at much finer spatiotemporal scales, estimated responses within, rather than across regions, and did not assume fox suppression to be a linear function of bait-density. We found fox suppression to be a mostly linear function of bait-density in the Otway Ranges, but not the Glenelg region. Fox suppression is expected to taper off at high poison-bait densities because foxes only need to be exposed to one (fresh) poison-bait to receive a lethal dose and foxes may also increase bait caching at high bait densities [@saunders2007improving]. However, this is unlikely to be the case in the Glenelg region as fox suppression tapered off in the mid-range and given fox suppression picked up again at higher bait densities. Ultimately, benefits to threatened native prey is the best metric of fox control effectiveness and LNP's increased linearly with poison-bait density in the Glenelg region. 

Our poison-bait densities (maximum 1.14 baits km^-2^) were far below the recommended 5 - 10 baits km^-2^ [@saunders2007improving]. This recommendation was mostly based on fox control programmes in more arid regions [where foxes have larger home-ranges; **ref**], which did not bury poison-baits [making them likely to taken by non-target species; **ref**] and had less frequently bait replacements [@saunders2007improving]. In similar environmental conditions to our study, @dexter2009impact also found buried baits at 1-km intervals along forest roads with monthly replacement to be effective at suppressing fox activity. 

We found inconclusive evidence that fox control caused a mesopredator release of feral cats in terms of detectability and occupancy. We observed an increase in cat detectability with fox control in the Otway Ranges, and cat occupancy was slightly higher in sites with fox control in the Glenelg region (according to the occupancy-detection model). However, cat occupancy did not change across the gradients of poison-bait density in either region (GAMs). Occupancy can be a problematic metric for species like cats which are distributed widely across continuous habitats and because 'sites' are ill-defined (relative to, say, a bird nest), and so occupancy is a function of density, home-range size and behaviour [@efford2012occupancy; @broadley2019density; @neilson2018animal; @stewart2018species]. This is particularly concerning given mesopredator release is expected to alter mesopredator behaviour [@brashares2010ecological], for example @molsher2017mesopredator found feral cats to decrease home-range size and alter site selection following fox control. We therefore expect occupancy studies such as ours to provide little clarity on mesopredator release. Spatially explicit capture-recapture models offer a solution to this problem. While spatially capture-recapture methods have intensive data requirements, these method have shown promise for feral cats in the Otway Ranges [@rees2019unexpectedly].

Many studies have investigated individual invasive predator preferences for the different resources within home-ranges (via telemetry), but we have a comparatively poor understanding of what drives the patchy occurrences within their extremely broad distributions. Consistent with resource-selection analyses, we found predators to more likely occupy sites proximal to edges of non-native forests, particularly foxes. Short-term rainfall had strong, nonlinear effects on predator occurrence, but no impact on our prey study species. This was surprising given these species reliance on soil moisture levels being just right access soil invertebrate prey and plant materials for food [@paull2013fragmentation; @wilson2012terrestrial]. Rainfall effects on invasive predators have been documented in arid regions with boom-bust rainfall dynamics [@greenville2014bottom], but not in temperate regions such as ours. Given the similar effects of rainfall deviations to both predators in the Glenelg region, we expect this could be mediated by changes in smaller prey species [@hale2016fire]. 

In the Glenelg region, LNP's likely improved with fox control because they (and other macropods) appear to more strongly limited by fox predation, whereas SBB's tend to be more closely associated with cat populations [@hunter2018not; @arthur2012relative]. This would also help explain why SBB occupancy was highest in heathy woodlands, where cat occupancy is lowest. However, it may just be that foxes have not been suppressed below a threshold which releases SBB's from top-down pressure [@moseby2019understanding] - foxes still persist in the long-baited landscapes of the Glenelg region. Alternatively, the population density of SBB's may have improved with fox control, but there may be no more suitable habitat for SBB's to colonise. This is plausible given the response of SBB occupancy to fire was the strongest effect in our study--SBB's are dependent on the right amount of habitat structure [@swan2015predicting], presumably for shelter against predation. Given open cat populations are incredibly difficult to suppress [@lazenby2015effects], SBB-friendly fire regimes are a key priority for managers to maintain in south-west Victoria. 

Our work adds to the growing body of evidence that fire regimes are key to maintaining suitable habitat for small-medium sized native mammals [@monamy2000small], but also impacts predators over the long-term. Our finding that species responses to fire vary across vegetation types supports the 'dynamic vegetation' hypothesis [@nimmo2014why] and previous research in these regions [@swan2015predicting]. For the most part, we observed slight variations in TSF responses across vegetation types, except for LNP's who increased with TSF in heathy landscapes but decreased with TSF in heathy woodlands. Studies often merge similar vegetation types due to some groups with having small sample sizes, however, we found no clear way of condensing vegetation types that was relevant to multiple species. Our hierarchical specification of the TSF and vegetation type interaction was extremely powerful in this regard: allowing separate responses for each vegetation type, while sharing information across vegetations [and providing confidence that there is data to back-up differently shaped responses given the  penalisation to the average response; @pedersen2019hierarchical]. Preserving long unburnt heathy landscapes is a key management priority in south-west Victoria as they are strongholds for both SBBs and LNPs. 

Our study demonstrates the value of bringing together multiple smaller datasets to compare management effectiveness. Accounting for other drivers of species in models which estimate responses to management is critical, but rarely undertaken. For example, startling declines and local extinctions have occurred following 40 years of fox control in south-west Western Australia [@wayne2017recoveries], but the Intergovernmental Panel of Climate Change has identified this region as a 'drying hotspot', which offers an alternative explanation [@drying2021kala]. Another long-term fox control study without experimental designs in Booderee National Park also struggled to tease apart the effect of fox control from other potential drivers of prey declines [@lindenmayer2018conservation]. However, experimental designs are not immune to confounding variables. The Glenelg Ark fox control program, a thrice replicated before-after-control-impact-paired-series experiment with annual and simultaneous monitoring of 240 sites [@robley2014long], is undoubtedly the strongest study design into fox control effectiveness in Australia. However, since fox control commenced here, recent fire events have been heavily skewed to baited landscapes, with the vast majority of long-unburnt vegetation--critically important habitat for prey species--occurring in unbaited landscapes (Fig. \@ref(fig:veg-tsf-violin). We were able to account for this confounding variable with the additional 424 sites in the Glenelg region, as well as the Otway Ranges datasets--providing a wide range of fire history patterns in each vegetation type with and without fox control (Fig. \@ref(fig:veg-tsf-violin). 

Fox control is a major expenditure of Australian conservation and agricultural resources [approximately AUD 16 million annually; @mcleod2004counting]--it is critical to ensure cost-effectiveness from both a monetary and ethical standpoint. Here we demonstrate that effectiveness is a function of control effort, although, large reductions in invasive apex predator occupancy don't always produce consistent threatened species benefits. Prey may not benefit from predator control in terms of occupancy unless there is suitable habitat to colonise into. Managers therefore require detailed information on the occurrence and drivers of threatened native prey within regions, however, forcing responses to be linear and constant across heterogeneous landscapes can be misleading. Our work highlights the importance of fine-scale monitoring, considering multiple drivers and tailoring conservation strategies to local contexts. A key limitation of our study is that we did not directly account for interactions among species and threats. Our models provide a starting point to inform these more complicated models which can usually only handle few species and covariates [@kery2020applied].

Despite substantially fewer presences, threatened prey GAMs had considerably better model fits than invasive predators. 





In fact, while there is a growing body of evidence that invasive predators impacts are heightened in recently burnt areas [@hradsky2017human; @hradsky2017responses; @mcgregor2014landscape; @leahy2016amplified; @green2006immediate; @meek2000home; @mcgregor2016extraterritorial], we have a poor understanding of how long-term fire patterns impacts invasive predators [@hradsky2020conserving; @geary2020predator].


Fortunately, our work demonstrates that fox control is not the only effective tool mangers have--maintaining optimal fire regimes is a high priority for threatened native mammals in temperate landscapes. However, not only do optimal fire regimes vary across species, but they can be entirely conflicting for the same species across different vegetation communities.

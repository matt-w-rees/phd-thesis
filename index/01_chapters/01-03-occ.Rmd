# Fire and poison-baiting manipulate invasive predator and threatened prey occurrence within temperate landscapes {#occ}

## Abstract {-}

Invasive predators are often lethally controlled because of their considerable biodiversity and socioeconomic impacts. Invasive predators are resilient to low-level culling efforts, but management across broad spatiotemporal scales is expensive. Quantifying invasive predator suppression, unintended outcomes (e.g. release of subordinate invasive species) and benefits to threatened species across gradients of control effort is key to designing cost-effective control programs. However, signals may be confounded by co-occurring threats and management actions. 

In this study we examined the response of four species to invasive predator management programmes across two fireprone regions: the introduced apex predator targeted through poison-baiting (red fox *Vulpes vulpes*), an introduced mesopredator suspected to inadvertently benefit (feral cat *Felis catus*); and two threatened native mammals preyed upon by both invasive predators (southern brown bandicoot *Isoodon obesulus* and long-nosed potoroo *Potorous tridactylus*). With data from 3667 camera-trap deployments, we built hierarchical generalised additive models to estimate changes in species occurrences across (1) gradients of poison-bait density, and (2) fire history patterns among different vegetation communities, while (3) accounting for forest edge-effects. 

Poison-baiting programs suppressed introduced red foxes across both regions--the degree to which depending on poison-bait density--but had highly variable impacts on threatened native prey. Fox control had no impact on southern brown bandicoot occurrence in either region, nor for potoroos in one region. However, in the other region, fox control was critical to the persistence of the long-nosed potoroo. Occurrence of both invasive predators and native prey was driven by an interaction between vegetation type and fire. Response to time since fire varied considerably, both across species and among species in different vegetation types. 

Our study demonstrates how variable invasive predator control outcomes are, highlighting the importance of long-term, multispecies monitoring. Invasive predator control and prescribed fire are important tools land managers use to manipulate mammalian communities, but optimal regimes are species-specific and need to be tailored to the fine-scale landscape-context.

## Introduction

Conservation managers intervene in ecosystems with the aim of stemming rapid biodiversity loss, but outcomes are rarely quantified (ref). This is integral to ensuring cost-effective allocation of conservation resources and to monitor potential unintended consequences of ecosystem intervention. However, reliable inferences about the effects of landscape-scale management are often difficult to achieve as most wildlife populations are naturally patchy and fluctuate through time due to natural drivers, co-occurring threats and concurrent management actions [@tulloch2016using]. 

Management of invasive predators is a classic example [@doherty2017stop]. Because they are major drivers of global biodiversity loss, introduced predators are actively controlled--usually lethally--throughout much their non-native ranges [@bellard2016global; @doherty2016invasive]. Concerningly, when multiple invasive predators co-occur, single-species control often has perverse effects on native biodiversity [@ballari2016potential]. There are several possible explanations for this. Firstly, invasive predators may not be suppressed below thresholds which native prey can tolerate--predators can be remarkably resilient to low-effort culling [@sabo2005stochasticity; @sinclair1998predicting; @moseby2019understanding; @lazenby2015effects]. Secondly, invasive predator suppression may 'release' subordinate invasive species which also threaten native prey [@ruscoe2011unexpected; @courchamp1999cats]. Thirdly, native prey may not be limited solely by top-down control [@banks1999predation]. Quantifying invasive predator suppression, unintended outcomes and native prey responses across gradients of control effort is key to designing cost-effective invasive predator management programs [@walsh2012unexpected; @baxter2008cost]. However, signals can still be confounded by co-occurring threats and management actions.

Quantifying impact of planned fire on introduced and native fauna is similarly complex. The effects of fire on vegetation structure are long-term (decades - centuries), nonlinear and variable across environmental conditions [@haslem2011habitat]. Fire can therefore drive the persistence and extinction of native fauna populations by altering food and habitat resources, particularly the dense understorey vegetation used to shelter against predation [@monamy2000small]. Because post-fire regeneration of habitat structure varies across ecological communities, prey species distributed across heterogeneous landscapes can have variable responses to time since fire [@swan2015predicting; @nimmo2014why]. Predators are known to increase in abundance and more heavily predate vulnerable prey when understorey vegetation is removed in the short-term following fire, however long-term effects of fire on predators are unclear [@hradsky2020conserving; @geary2020predator]. Predicting the long-term ramifications of fire on predators and prey is a key challenge for managers who are tasked with stemming the decline of native fauna populations while simultaneously protecting against the increasing threat of large wildfires [@clarke2008catering]. 

Disentangling the complex and potentially interacting effects of invasive predator and fire management on native fauna is particularly pertinent to Australia, where native mammals have experienced some of the worst declines in recent world history [@woinarski2019reading]. Native mammals have declined primarily due to two introduced predators and altered fire regimes following European colonisation [@woinarski2015ongoing]. However, habitat fragmentation certainly plays a role [@may1996influence] in prey declines and there is growing concern around rainfall dynamics, even in temperate ecosystems [@hale2016fire]. Integrated predator management programs are rare; instead, the red fox *Vulpes vulpes* (hereafter 'fox') is far more commonly controlled than the feral cat *Felis catus* (hereafter 'cat'). There is some evidence, albeit highly uncertain, that fox suppression could cause a 'mesopredator release' of cats [@hunter2018not]. This would help explain dramatic declines reported in native prey following long-term fox control programs in Australia [e.g., @wayne2017recoveries; @lindenmayer2018conservation; @duncan2020eruptive]. However, it is equally plausible that prey succumbed to co-occurring threats over time.  

In this study we assessed the outcomes of two fox control programs in fire-affected regions of south-eastern Australia. We experimentally deployed 3667 camera-traps around one long-term and one recently commenced fox control programs in protected conservation areas. We accounted for the potentially nonlinear effects of fox control effort (1080 poison-bait density), variable responses to time since fire (0 - XX years) across vegetation communities, rainfall dynamics and proximity to cleared areas, on species occurrences using generalised additive models (hereafter 'GAMs'). Quantifying apex predator suppression and testing the mesopredator release hypothesis [@crooks1999mesopredator] are important steps towards an understanding of prey responses to lethal predator control.

## Methods

### Study species
In this study we focused on two invasive predators and two shared native mammalian prey species listed as threatened under federal legislation. The introduced predators share a similar functional niche similar and compete for many of the same resources [@glen2005complex]. Both prey species are solitary, medium-sized, ground-dwelling marsupials. They nest in dense understorey vegetation during the day and turn over large quantities of soil to feed on invertebrates, plant material and fungi at night [@van2008mammals]. 

#### Red fox 
Introduced in the early 1870's, European red foxes (~6 kg) and are now ubiquitous across the Australian mainland expect for tropical areas of the north [@fairfax2019dispersal]. Fox density varies from 0.1 foxes km^-2^ in semi-arid regions to more than four foxes km^-2^ in productive environments such as farmlands (ref). home-range size follows the opposite pattern, varying from less than 100 ha in urban and productive agricultural environments, to upwards of 2000 ha in the arid zone (ref). Foxes usually hunt alone but live in family groups comprising a dominant pair and their juvenile cubs. If resource availability is high, adult offspring may also remain with the group. Foxes have a strongly seasonal lifecycle: mating occurs in mid-winter, cubs are born in spring (average litter sizes being 3 to 6 cubs), and offspring disperse in autumn and early winter, before breeding that season. Foxes predate on and scavenge a wide variety of foods; including livestock, small arthropods and fruits [@fleming2021diet].

#### Feral cat 
Feral cats (~4 kg) took less than a century to spread across the entire Australian continent, owing to their wide thermal tolerance without relying on free drinking water [@abbott2008spread]. Feral cat densities range from 0.01 to 1.5 cats km^-2^ in natural Australian environments [@legge2017enumerating]. Female cat home-range size range scale negatively with landscape productivity [@bengsen2016feral], from less than 100 ha to more than 600 ha [@hamerdiffering]. Male cat home-range size varies with that of females, but is larger on average because dominant males typically overlap the ranges of two to three females. Some individuals do not have a fixed home-range [@roshier2021space]. Feral cats can breed several times a year with litters of up to five kittens [@jones1982ecology]. Cats are largely solitary across Australia’s typical natural environments, although form dense matrilineal societies in areas with rich resources (e.g., farms, rubbish tips, seabird colonies). Feral cats are obligatory carnivores, preferring live prey but do occasionally scavenge - they do not readily take most types of meat bait [@fisher2015cat]. 

#### Southern brown bandicoot
The southern brown bandicoot (hereafter 'SBB'; ~1.2 kg) *Isodon obesulus* is distributed in isolated populations across the southern coast of Australia and in Tasmania. SBB's are mostly found in heathy landscapes, woodlands and dry forest type. SBB's are solitary; home-ranges vary from 0.5 - 6 ha [@lobert1990home]. Females have remarkable reproductive rates: a gestation period of 11 days, can produce two - three litters per breeding season (6 months), averaging two to four young, who become independent at age 60 days [@brown2010national]. Estimates of mainland SBB density average approximately 130 individuals km^-2^ [@pentland1999population].

#### Long-nosed potoroo 
The long-nosed potoroo (hereafter 'LNP'; ~1.3 kg) *Potorous tridactylus* currently has a patchy distribution down the eastern coast of Australia from south-eastern Queensland to south-eastern South Australia, as well as the north and east coasts of Tasmania. LNP's occur across a wide range of vegetation communities from heathlands to rainforests. Females give birth to a single young, up to four times a year, providing each with ~133 days of lactation in the pouch [@frankham2011population]. In south-west Victoria, LNP's have a home-range size of 1.4 - 2 ha [@bennett1987conservation]. LNP populations are generally small in size, at densities of 20 - 60 individuals km^-2^, with low rates of both juvenile recruitment and individual turnover [@mason1998habitat; @frankham2011population].

### Study area and camera-trapping 
We deployed and collated camera-trap data across two distinct regions in south-west Victoria, Australia: the Glenelg region and Otway Ranges (Fig. \@ref(fig:occ-map)). Introduced foxes and cats are the only medium-large functional mammalian terrestrial predators across both regions: native dingoes *Canis familiaris* are long absent throughout, tiger quolls *Dasyurus maculatus* are long-absent in the Glenelg region and likely functionally extinct in the Otway Ranges (last confirmed sighting in 2014 despite extensive camera-trapping). In broad sections of each region, government land managers conduct ongoing targeted fox control for biodiversity conservation. Poison baits containing 3 mg of sodium mono-fluroacetate ('1080') are buried at a depth of 12 - 15 cm at 1-km intervals along accessible forest tracks and roads. Different road densities results in spatially variable poison-bait densities. Managers frequently implement prescribed fire across both regions. 

In the Glenelg region, Gunditjmara country, large patches of natural vegetation--mostly lowland forests and heathy woodlands—are fragmented by pastoral farming and residential properties (Fig. \@ref(fig:occ-map)). Foxes are subject to lethal control in three distinct forest blocks since October 2005, with fortnightly replacement of 1080 poison-baits [@robley2014long]. 40 camera-trap sites in each forest block, as well as 40 sites in three similar, unbaited forest blocks (240 sites total) to the north are simultaneously surveyed annually under the 'Glenelg Ark' fox control program. Hair-tubes were used to monitor prey species from 2005 - 2013 [data presented in @robley2014long], which were replaced by camera-traps in 2013 [camera-trap data from 2013-2019 is presented in this study; @robley2020glenelg]. In early 2018, four out of the six forest block (two baited, two unbaited) were additionally surveyed with grids of 99 - 110 camera-traps (M.W.R PhD surveys). This totals 2039 camera-trap deployments in the Glenelg region, collected in a control-impact experimental design (foxes had been continuously controlled for at 8 - 13 years in the treatment landscapes during these camera-trap surveys). 

The Otway Ranges, Gadubanud, Kirrae Wurrung, Gulidjan and Wadawurrung country, is a largely continuous patch of natural vegetation with a strong east-west rainfall gradient. A matrix of cool temperate rainforest and wet forest at high-altitudes in the south-west descend into a large heathland directly north, and into dry forests and then heathlands to the north-east.  Fox-baiting commenced in some small sections in 2008 and large-scale systematic baiting began in 2016 - 2017 under the 'Otway Ark' program [@robley2019otway]. Poison baits were initially replaced weekly for six weeks, before changing to monthly bait-replacement. There was an ~6 month pause in replacement in the second half of 2018. Fortnightly bait-replacement occurred for four weeks afterwards, then returning to monthly bait-replacement. A large section to the north-west remains unbaited, but monitored as an experimental non-treatment site. Otway Ark managers surveyed 372 sites (not simultaneously) with camera-traps annually; we present one 'before' survey and two 'after' surveys of each site from 2016 - 2018, totalling 1113 camera-trap deployments [@robley2019otway]. An additional before-after control-impact (simultanesouly paired series survey was conducted in the Western section of the Otway Ranges annually from 2017 - 2019 (M.W.R PhD surveys). This added a further 195 sites and 524 camera-trap deployments. 

All camera-trap deployments consisted of a Reconyx (Holmen, Wisconsin) brand camera-trap (white or infrared flash), attached to a tree or a metal picket, facing a lure. One study across both regions (M.W.R PhD surveys) positioned camera-traps low on a tree (around 15 - 30 cm above the ground – angled only slightly downwards) facing a tuna oil lure approximately 2 - 2.5 m away [detailed in @rees2019unexpectedly]. The Glenelg Ark and Otway Ark fox monitoring programs positioned camera-traps higher on a tree or a metal picket (at least 40 cm above ground) and angled more strongly downwards toward a lure approximately 1 - 1.5 m away [@robley2020glenelg; @robley2019otway]. These lures consisted of peanut butter, golden syrup and rolled oats mixed into a small ball, placed within a tea strainer or PVC pipe container and secured either to the ground, or 20 - 60 cm above ground on a wooden stake. All set-ups were effective in detecting all four target species.

### Generalised additive models 
We modelled occurrence probability for each species (response variable) using binomial generalised additive mixed-effects models implemented in the 'mgcv' R-package [@wood2017generalized]. We specified a model offset to account for differences in camera-trap survey durations and a random effect for each unique site to account for repeat sampling. We used the same model structure and explanatory variables (detailed in the sections below) for each species. We used the double penalty model selection approach, which penalises the null space in addition to the range space (i.e. shrinking wiggly terms to linear terms) of the spline basis, meaning covariate effects can be entirely removed from the model [@marra2011practical].

#### 1080 poison-bait density
1080 poison-baits are deployed to suppress foxes and therefore benefit native prey. As cats are subordinate to foxes, they may also benefit. The degree of fox suppression is likely a function of the spatial arrangement (i.e. poison-baiting density) relative to fox home-range size and replacement schedule of 1080 baits [@fleming1996ground; @benshemesh2020citizen]. We therefore summed the number of poison-bait stations within a 2.3 km radius around each camera-trap deployment - the average maximum distance foxes in these region travel from their home-range centre [@hradsky2017human]. Densities ranged from 1 - 19 baits per fox-home range across both regions. We modelled a smooth function of 1080 poison-bait density with a thin plate regression spline and a factor smooth basis to model the response separately for each region. Due to wet weather impacting road conditions across both regions, some poison-bait stations are inaccessible, and so, some baits do not get replaced at times. Due to a lack of data on missing replacements, we did not account for this. There was also a ~6 month pause in bait replacement in the Otway Ranges we did not account for (the only other option was model a bait density of 0 during this time, but there very likely baits still available in these stations and this would have ignored prior fox suppression).

#### Time since fire and vegetation type 
We expected species occurrences to differ across vegetation types and with time since fire, and to have different responses to time since fire in each different vegetation type [as post-fire regeneration occurs at different speeds; @mccollgausden2019pathways; @swan2015predicting]; we therefore modelled an interaction between time since fire (in years; hereafter 'TSF') and vegetation type. We used coarse fire scar mapping provided by government managers to calculate the years since the last fire for each camera-trap deployment. We identified the Ecological Vegetation Class [hereafter 'EVC'; standard units for vegetation classification in Victoria; @delwp2020] group for each unique camera-trap site, 8 EVC groups in total. We surveyed 20 unique sites in rainforests, which are interspersed (primarily in low lying gullies) throughout wet and damp forests in the south-eastern Otway Ranges. Given the similarity and finescale interspersion of these EVC groups, and that both rarely or never experience fire, we merged them together (hereafter referred to as 'wet forests'). We specified this using a hierarchical model structure, which estimated an average TSF response ('global smoother'), along with EVC group-level smoothers with shared wiggliness [i.e., model GS detailed in @pedersen2019hierarchical]. This shares information on TSF responses across EVC groups and penalises functions which deviate strongly from the average response. Given these are separate smooths and the double penalty model selection was turned on; the global or group-level TSF smoothers could be removed entirely from the model if either were not supported by the data. 

#### Recent rainfall
Changes in short-term rainfall dynamics likely impact both invasive predators and native prey [@greenville2014bottom; @wilson2012terrestrial; @paull2013fragmentation; @arthur2012relative]. We calculated the percentage difference in rainfall from the long-term median that had occurred prior to start of each camera-trap survey in six, 12, 18 and 24 month periods. For each camera-trap site, we used data from the nearest weather station [n = 11; @BOM2021]. We modelled rainfall using a thin plate regression spline and a factor smooth basis to model the response separately for each region (same specification as 1080 poison-bait density). For each species, we fit a separate model for each time period and compared them using Akaike Information Criterion (hereafter 'AIC') scores [@burnham2004multimodel]. 

#### Proximity to forest edge 
Invasive predators are well-documented to prefer edges between forest and cleared land as they facilitate both efficient movement and increased hunting success [@hradsky2017human; @nichols2019evaluation; @may1996influence]. We therefore included a smooth term (thin plate regression spline) of the minimum distance from each camera-trap site to the nearest area of non-native vegetation area. We calculated this by inverting the Department of Environment, Land, Water and Planning native vegetation extent shapefile layer and removing cleared areas smaller than 30 ha [@geary2020predators].

### Cumulative detection probabilities
We did not incorporate imperfect detection in the GAMs. However, we calculated the cumulative detection probability for each species by fitting an occupancy-detection model [@mackenzie2002estimating] using the 'unmarked' R-package. We used single-season models with a random intercept for each unique site to account for repeat sampling. For foxes, we allowed detectability and occupancy parameters to vary as a binary function of fox control, but kept these parameters constant for the other species. We then calculated the calculated the probability that each species would have been detected if it was present for one to 93 days [the maximum survey duration; @garrard2008when]. 

All analyses were conducted in R version 3.6.3 [@R].

## Results
Overall, we deployed 3667 camera-traps (survey duration 10 - 93 days; mean 47) at 1232 unique sites across both regions - totalling 172,036 trapnights. We detected foxes on 1453 camera-traps, cats on 1010, SBBs on 394 and LNPs on 331. Predators were ubitiqous across both regions (Table \@ref(tab:occ-naive)). Despite being detected in all vegetation types, the majority of SBB and LNP detections took place in heathy communities. SBB's were also commonly found in lowland forests, while there were also relatively high presences of LNP's in herb-rich woodlands (Table \@ref(tab:occ-naive)). SBB's were largely absent from the Otway wet forests and rainforests - the few detections occurred adjacent to other vegetation types (SBB's are largely replaced by long-nosed bandicoots *Perameles nasuta* in the wet forests).

### Generalised additive models 
Despite substantially fewer presences, threatened prey GAMs had considerably better model fits than invasive predators. The fox model had an adjusted R-square value of 0.28 and explained 28% of the null deviance; the cat model had respective values of 0.25 and 26%. Adjusted R-square and deviance explained values were 0.38 and 44% for the SBB GAM, and 0.51 and 56% for the LNP GAM, respectively.

#### 1080 poison-bait density
Fox control reduced the probability of fox occurrence by up to 88% in the Glenelg region and 70% in the Otway Ranges (Fig. \@ref(fig:occ-1080)a). Fox suppression scaled (negatively) approximately linearly with poison-bait density in the Otway Ranges, but nonlinearly in the Glenelg region; 6 bait stations within a fox home-range suppressed fox occurrence just as much as 7 - 13 bait stations did. Because fox occurrence probability was lower to begin with in the Otway Ranges (0.56; 95% CI: 0.49 - 0.64) relative to the Glenelg region (0.76; 95% CI: 0.70 - 0.82), foxes were suppressed by the maximum bait density (19 per fox home-range) to a similar level in both regions: a 0.17 (95% CI: 0.05 - 0.46) occurrence probability in the Otways and 0.09 (95% CI: 0.03 - 0.24) in the Glenelg region. However, there was very high uncertainty around fox suppression at 10 - 19 baits per fox home-range in the Otway Ranges. 

There was no discernible effect of fox control on cat occurrence across both regions or either prey species in the Otway Ranges (Fig. \@ref(fig:occ-1080)b-d). In the Glenelg region, fox control had a weak positive effect on SBB occurrence (up to a 1.5-fold increase, although uncertainty around this estimate was high; Fig. \@ref(fig:occ-1080)c) and a strong positive effect on LNP occurrence (up to a 7-fold increase; Fig. \@ref(fig:occ-1080)d). In the Otway Ranges, fox-bait density was associated slightly negatively associatied with the occurrence probability of both prey species, although uncertainty around these estimates was high (Fig. \@ref(fig:occ-1080)c-d).

#### Time since fire and vegetation type 
All species responded to TSF differently across vegetation types (Fig. \@ref(fig:occ-tsf); \@ref(fig:occ-tsf-gs)). The global TSF smooth (i.e., average response) was selected out of the cat model (Fig. \@ref(fig:occ-tsf-gs)), indicating responses were to TSF were completely dependent on vegetation type. Foxes, SBB's and LNP's all followed an average response TSF response across the regions, with deviations across vegetation types. We observed no common patterns to TSF across species, both on average and within each vegetation type.

Foxes declined linearly with TSF on average (Fig. \@ref(fig:occ-tsf-gs)a), although peaked around 40 years post-fire in lowland forests. Cats had the weakest reponses to TSF; occurrence was highest in both recently burnt and long-unburnt heathland areas, but the opposite response was seen in herb-rich woodlands - cat occurrence peaked around 50 years after fire (Fig. \@ref(fig:occ-tsf)b). Irrespective of TSF, cat occurrence was lowest in heathy woodlands and lowland forests, highest in Otway wet forests. 

SBB's had the strongest and most complex (i.e., wiggly) interactions with TSF, with occurrence peaking 20 and 75 years post-fire (Fig. \@ref(fig:occ-tsf-gs)c), although the strength of the 75 year peak varied considerably across vegetation communities (Fig. \@ref(fig:occ-tsf)c). On average, LNP's increased linearly with TSF (Fig. \@ref(fig:occ-tsf-gs)d), particularly in heathy woodlands (Fig. \@ref(fig:occ-tsf-gs). However, LNP's had the opposite response in herb-rich woodlands: occurrence declined with TSF. 


#### Recent rainfall
Rainfall impacted the occurrence of invasive predators but not either native prey species. The fox model which considered rainfall deviations in the prior 18 months was ranked highest relative to the models with six, 12, and 24 month periods; at least 2.9 AIC units lower. The top-ranked model for all other species considered rainfall in a six month period. For cats, there was strong evidence this model performed better (at least 17.5 AIC units lower) than models which considered previous rainfall in longer time periods. The rainfall term was removed for both the top-ranked SBB model (at least 2.2 AIC units lower than the other models) and the three top-ranked LNP models (indistinguishable based on AIC scores).

Despite the different time periods (18 and 6 months), fox and cat occurrence followed a similar nonlinear pattern to rainfall in the Glenelg region (Fig. \@ref(fig:occ-rainfall)). Here, predator occurrence was highest when rainfall was lowest as well as in the mid-range of above average rainfall. Foxes in the Otway Ranges responded similarly to rainfall as foxes in the Glenelg region when rainfall was below average, but had opposite responses to glenelg foxes when rainfall was above average. Rainfall had no discernable effect on cat occurrence in the Otways. 

#### Proximity to forest edge 
Fox occurrence strongly declined with distance of up to two kilometres from the nearest area of non-native vegetation (Fig. \@ref(fig:occ-dist)a). The impact of forest edge on all other species was weak; cat occurrence slightly declined and prey species slightly increased, although there was considerable uncertainty in each of these responses (Fig. \@ref(fig:occ-dist)b-d). 

### Cumulative detection probabilities
All species had a greater than 75% probability of detection for the average camera-trap survey length (Fig. \@ref(fig:occ-cumdet)). Fox detectability was more than twice as low in landscapes with fox control (0.033; 95% CI: 0.030 - 0.036) than in landscapes without (0.077; 95% CI: 0.075 - 0.080). Cats were the least detectable species. Detectability of threatened prey species was high, reaching a 95% detection probability for a survey duration of 38 and 20 days for SBBs and LNPs, respectively.

## Discussion

Identifying management effects is challenging across heterogeneous, multi-stressor systems. 
In our study, not only did functionally similar species respond to fire and apex predator management differently, but species themselves responded differently across landscape contexts and broad regions. 
Importance of species-specific monitoring and management. 
Luckily we've current management tools can be wielded to decrease threats (e.g. fox occurrence) and promote habitat suitability (e.g. fire). Just need considerable effort (foxes), and multispecies planning which is variable across habitat types. 
Assuming population-wide responses, linear responses is misleading. 
Many of these responses were nonlinear, reinforcing that forcing straight lines through biological processes can lead to misunderstanding [e.g., wolkovich2021simple]. 

Fox suppression. 

Threatened species benefits to fox control. 

Limitations to occupancy. 

Fire - dynamic habitat. 
Predator responses - first evidence.
Sure, directly measuring habitat structure would have been better, but managers need to plan without this information. 
Different species responses are surprising, overlooking species interactions. 





Here we demonstrate that large reductions in invasive apex predator occurrence don't produce consistent threatened species benefits. For example, a high density of 1080 poison-baits in the Glenelg region, Australia, largely maintains the persistence of LNP's in these landscapes, but appeared to slightly worsen outcomes for this threatened species in the neighbouring Otway Ranges. Fortunately, our work demonstrates that fox control is not the only effective tool mangers have--maintaining optimal fire regimes is a high priority for threatened native mammals in temperate landscapes. However, not only do optimal fire regimes vary across species, but they can be entirely conflicting for the same species across different vegetation communities. Our work highlights the importance of fine-scale monitoring and tailoring conservation strategies to local contexts. 

Ours is the study first to quantify fox suppression across a gradient of 1080 poison-bait densities. Previous studies have not considered how baiting effort varies spatially when analysing the response of foxes and other species, rather averaging across the entire fox control program. There is a huge range in bait densities and replacement schedules for fox control across Australia. Compare to other studies and bait density recommendations. 
The impact of poison-bait densities is relevant to the home-range size of the target species, which for foxes varies considerably (Main et al 2020) - caution needs to be taken when extrapolating to other sites. Ultimately, the best metric for fox control effectiveness is the improvement to native prey persistence. 

Fox-bait density strongly correlated with fox suppression, however, the threatened species we surveyed had weak and inconsistent responses to fox-bait density. SBB's were mostly unaffected. Perhaps this is because bandicoots may more closely follow patterns in cat populations (Catling). On the other hand, LNP's (and other macropods) often benefit the most from fox control (hunter), but only did so in the Glenelg region. The most likely explanation for the lack of positive threatened species responses in the Otway Ranges were because we only surveyed for 0 - 3 years (relative to XX--XX years post-baiting in the Glenelg region) and did not account for time-lag effects. While these species have very short recruitment periods and so have the ability to respond quickly in terms of population density, we assumed that foxes are limiting the availability in suitable habitat for CWR mammals. Rather, we found that vegetation type and TSF were strong drivers of CWR mammal habitat suitability. 

Contrary to the mesopredator release hypothesis, we observed no impact of fox control on cat occurrence probability. This may be because foxes do not suppress feral cat across these region, or because occurrence is too coarse a metric to uncover interactions between these species. Cats were widespread, and of all the species, had the lowest detectability, and the other explanatory variables relatively weak effects on their occurrence. Our occurrence models threw away rich information on detection rates, masking potential behavioural and population density effects.

Our work adds to the growing body of evidence that fire regimes are key to maintaining suitable habitat for small-medium sized native mammals. However, our study demonstrates that species response to fire can vary spatially. For local managers, preserving long unburnt heathy landscapes is a key management priority as they are strongholds for SBBs and LNPs. On the other hand, fresh burns in herb-rich woodland may promote LNP persistence. We saw weaker effects on the generalist invasive predators, contrary to some short-term experiments. This is unsurprising given our coarse, long-term (year) resolution, predator responses to fire and mostly finished within ~3? months. Our result suggests that managers can focus on the heightened threat of invasive predators immediately post-fire (Hradsky refs) rather than over the long-term. 

Invasive predators are well-documented to prefer forest edges, this was true for foxes but not for cats in our study. For foxes, this effect lasted for 2 km into the forest interior, but no effect was detected for cats. GAMs useful for quantifying this, rather than arbitrarily defining categorical edge habitat or assuming edge effects are linear. The weak and uncertain increase in CWR mammal occurrence with distance is intuitive because there is more habitat away from edges, and less foxes. 

While increasing poison-bait density can suppress foxes, Australian threatened native mammals may not benefit unless habitat structure is maintained using careful fire regimes. Failure to account for these changing environmental conditions would have produced substantial noise around the fox control effect. Improved inference will likely come from comparing a range of population metrics, such as behaviour and density.
Invasive predators, fire, as well as changes to rainfall and fire regimes are pervasive biodiversity threats throughout the globe, including within protected areas. However, averaging effects across populations can be misleading because species responses vary. 

## GY

This effect was stronger with less uncertainty in the Glenelg region, where fortnightly poison-bait replacement had been occurring for 8 - 13 years. Fox suppression here was nonlinear: indicating 6 bait stations within a fox home-range reduced fox occurrence just as much as 7 - 13 bait stations did. In the Otway Ranges, poison-bait density had a linear, but weaker suppressive effect on foxes than in the Glenelg region. Here fox control had occurred over a shorter-term (0 - 2.5 years) with less frequent bait replacements.

Fox control is a major expenditure of Australian conservation resources, estimated at AUD 16 million per annum on fox control (McLeod 2004). It is therefore critical to ensure fox control is cost-effective in improving the persistence of threatened native prey. Foxes in Australia are primarily managed through 1080 (sodium fluoroacetate) poison-baiting [@saunders2010impacts]. Levels of fox suppression vary widely across studies; ranging from severe (Berry et al., 2014; Thomson et al., 2000) to small reductions in fox activity (Bengsen, 2014; Newsome, Crowther, & Dickman, 2014), but also increases (Lieury et al., 2015; Towerton, Dickman, Kavanagh, & Penman, 2016; Marlow et al. 2016) - likely reflecting differences in baiting intensity. @benshemesh2020citizen is the only study to have estimated fox suppression across a gradient of baiting density; confirming that increased effort leads to greater reductions in fox activity (scat counts on malleefowl *Leipoa ocellata* mounds). However, this was estimated using linear regression across five Australian states where fox ecology (e.g. density, home-range size, behaviour) and landscape context (e.g. productivity) differs [@benshemesh2020citizen]. To date, managers lack empirical information on how foxes (and subordinate species) respond to varying poison-bait densities within regions (i.e., management units). To guide cost-effectiveness, it is important to ascertain whether bait density is linearly associated with fox suppression, or whether there is a threshold beyond which foxes suppression diminishes. 

When multiple invasive species occur, single invasive species control often has perverse outcomes on native species [@ballari2016potential].

Experimental designs are called for to improve inference around fox control, but are not immune to these confounding effects of fire. For example Boodoree, western shied...This is highlighted by the Glenelg Ark program; using a Before-After-Control-Impact paired series experimental design with three spatial replicates makes it the most robustly monitored fox control experiment in Australia. However, landscapes subject to fox control have been  frequently burnt-- highlighting the reality of conducting broad-scale management experiments in-situ. These confounding factors, or perhaps a mesopredator release of feral cats, may explain why two threatened native prey species, the southern brown bandicoot *Isoodon obesulus* (hereafter 'SBB') and long-nosed potoroo *Potorous tridactylus* (hereafter 'LNP'), have had an inconsistent, underwhelming response to fox control in the Glenelg region, Australia. New fox control programs are popping up - contrasting patterns of these same species may offer insight. 

It is not clear whether this is the result of fox control, or due to other  This is partly because many fox control programs go unmonitored, or monitoring designs provides limited inference on effects of predator management relative to other drivers (reddiex).

Prescribed burning operations often require juggling asset protection against the needs of many native species for dense vegetation.

In fact, while there is a growing body of evidence that invasive predators impacts are heightened in recently burnt areas [@hradsky2017human; @hradsky2017responses; @mcgregor2014landscape; @leahy2016amplified; @green2006immediate; @meek2000home; @mcgregor2016extraterritorial], we have a poor understanding of how long-term fire patterns impacts invasive predators [@hradsky2020conserving; @geary2020predator].

Both invasive predator and native prey populations are impacted by wildfire and small-scale controlled burns used to prevent large wildfires. Animals rarely succumb to direct mortality from fire events (e.g. Garvey et al. 2010; Banks et al. 2011b; Leahy et al. 2015); population-level impacts usually following fire through altered food and habitat resources. Initially, fire removes understorey habitat structure prey used by prey for shelter, making hunting more efficient for predators.

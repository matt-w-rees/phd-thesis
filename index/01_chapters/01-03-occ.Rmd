# Fire and poison-baiting manipulate invasive predator and threatened prey occurrence within temperate landscapes {#occ}

## Abstract {-}

**Background**.  
Invasive predators are commonly managed using lethal control because they cause biodiversity and socioeconomic losses. Invasive predators are resilient to low-level culling efforts, but lethal control across broad spatiotemporal scales is expensive. Quantifying both invasive predator suppression, unintended outcomes (e.g. release of subordinate invasive species) and benefits to threatened species across gradients of control effort is key to designing cost-effective control programs. However, signals may be confounded by co-occuring threats and management actions (e.g. fire).

**Methods**.  
In this study we examined the response of four species to invasive predator management in two fireprone regions: the introduced apex predator targeted by lethal control (red fox *Vulpes vulpes*), an invasive mesopredator suspected to inadvertently benefit (feral cat *Felis catus*); and two threatened native mammals preyed upon by both invasive predators (southern brown bandicoot *Isoodon obesulus* and long-nosed potoroo *Potorous tridactylus*). With data from 3667 camera-trap deployments, we used hierarchical generalised additive models to estimate changes in species occurrences across (1) gradients of poison-bait density, as well as (2) time since fire across different vegetation communities, while (3) accounting for forest edge-effects. 

**Results**.  
Poison-baiting suppressed foxes across both regions--the degree to which depending on poison-bait density--but had highly variable impacts on threatened native prey. In one region, fox control was critical to the persistence of potoroos, but not bandicoots. However, more recently commenced fox control in the other region did not benefit either threatened species. This variation did not appear to be due to mesopredator release - we saw no signs of fox control impacting feral cat occurrence in either region.  
Vegetation type and fire were strong drivers of the entire mammal community. 
Heathlands and heathy woodlands are priority landscapes.

## Introduction

Conservation managers often intervene in ecosystems with the aim of stemming rapid biodiversity loss, but the benefits of management are rarely quantified. Understanding management outcomes is essential to ensure cost-effectiveness and detect potential unintended consequences. However, reliable inference is difficult to achieve because the effects of management need to be separated from natural drivers of populations, as well impacts of co-occurring threats and management. Further, we often have a poor understanding of what drives the patchy occurrence of species within their distributions, despite being the spatial scale management usually operates at, and a common metric used to evaluate conservation strategy success.

Invasive predators are also a leading causes of global biodiversity and economic declines [@bellard2016global; @doherty2016invasive]. Invasive predators can have greater impact on native prey relative to native predators because prey are naive to the threat invasive predators pose and lacked time to evolve antipredator behaviours [@sih2010predator; @salo2007alien]. According, their control--usually lethal--is a prevalent management strategy worldwide (**ref**). However, lethal invasive predator control outcomes are notoriously inconsistent. Invasive predators can be resilient to population disturbances, including low-effort control programs. It is therefore vital to carefully monitor invasive predator control programs; both in terms of quantifying predator suppression and benefits to native biodiversity of concern. 

When multiple invasive predators occur, single invasive species control often has perverse outcomes on native species [@ballari2016potential]. This is likely due to 'release' effects of subordinate invasive predators, i.e., mesopredator release. It is therefore imperative survey the broader community to monitor unintended consequences and conservation benefits.  

Australian native terrestrial mammals have experienced some of the worst declines in recent history. While habitat destruction is a key threatening process, mammalian extinctions have largely taken place within large tracts of native vegetation. These mammals perform important ecological roles - their decline can drastically impact ecosystem function. Mammals weighing between 35 and 5500 g ('critical weight range') have been hit hardest as they are the preferred meal size for both the red fox *Vulpes vulpes* (hereafter 'fox') and feral cat *Felis catus* (hereafter 'cat'), introduced following European invasion more than 230 years ago. Also increasingly recognising the role of altered fire regimes. While some animals may succumb to direct mortality from fire events, most impacts are indirect through longer-term changes in food and habitat resources following fire. Interactions between invasive predators and fire. 

More land in Australia has been managed for foxes than any other invasive vertebrates, primarily through continuous 1080 poison-baiting (Saunders, Gentle, & Dickman, 2010). However, native prey benefits are rarely demonstrated. This is partly because many fox control programs go unmonitored, or monitoring provides limited inference on native prey responses (reddiex), and partly because dramatic declines and local extinctions have been reported after long-term fox control (e.g. wayne; lindenmeyer; grampians; rock wallabies). This may be due to insufficient control effort to suppress fox to a level which benefits prey, or because fox suppression has 'released' feral cats (i.e., mesopredator release). However, we have little empirical evidence for either alternative. Few studies have quantified fox suppression across a gradient of control effort. Feral cats do appear to increase abundance following fox control, although there is considerable uncertainty around this (Hunter). Evaluating fox control is difficult due to co-occuring threats and management actions. 

Minimising the threat of large wildfires through small-scale controlled burns to reduce fuel-loads (dried vegetative substrate) is an increasingly important role of land managers. Prescribed burning operations require juggling asset protection against the often competing needs of native species. Animals response to fire are often measured using time since the last fire event, however, post-fire regeneration varies considerably across different vegetation communities. While sample sizes often prohibit estimating fire responses across different contexts, it is imperative to inform optimal fire regimes across heterogeneous landscapes. 

Experimental designs are called for to improve inference around fox control, but are not immune to these confounding effects of fire. For example Boodoree, western shied...This is highlighted by the Glenelg Ark program; using a Before-After-Control-Impact paired series experimental design with three spatial replicates makes it the most robustly monitored fox control experiment in Australia. However, landscapes subject to fox control have been  frequently burnt-- highlighting the reality of conducting broad-scale management experiments in-situ. These confounding factors, or perhaps a mesopredator release of feral cats, may explain why two threatened native prey species, the southern brown bandicoot *Isoodon obesulus* (hereafter 'SBB') and long-nosed potoroo *Potorous tridactylus* (hereafter 'LNP'), have had an inconsistent, underwhelming response to fox control in the Glenelg region, Australia. New fox control programs are popping up - contrasting patterns of these same species may offer insight. 

Here, we quantified changes in invasive predator and threatened native prey occurrence across 1080 poison-bait density gradients for two broadscale fox control programs, while accounting for the effects of fire regimes. From 3667 camera-trap deployments over seven years, we were able to survey mammals across a range of environmental conditions and management contexts across two broad regions implementing fox control in south-west Victoria, Australia. We used generalised additive models to fit nonlinear relationships between fox, cat, SBB and LNP occurrence and several spatial and temporal covariates, including (1) fox-bait density, (2) time since fire across vegetation communities. We hypothesised that: (1) fox-bait density would be associated with declines in fox occurrence, increases in SBB, LNP and cat occurrence (in accordance with the mesopredator release hypothesis), (2) species occurrence would vary with time since fire, but in slightly different ways across vegetation communities. We also accounted for habitat fragmentation, hypothesising that (4) predator occurrence would highest closest to cleared edges, and that threatened prey occurrence would be lowest here.

## Methods

### Study area
We collated camera-trap data across the Glenelg region and Otway Ranges in south-west Victoria, Australia (Fig. \@ref(fig:occ-map)). The terrestrial mammalian predator guild is depauperate throughout both regions; native dingoes *Canis familiaris* are long absent throughout, tiger quolls *Dasyurus maculatus* are long-absent in the Glenelg region and likely functionally extinct in the Otway Ranges (last confirmed sighting in 2014 despite extensive camera-trapping). Introduced foxes and cats are therefore the only medium-large functional mammalian terrestrial predators across both regions. The purpose of each collated study was to experimentally survey changes in the mammalian community due to fox control. In broad sections of each region, government land managers conduct ongoing targeted fox control for biodiversity conservation. Poison baits containing 3 mg of sodium mono-fluroacetate ('1080') are buried at a depth of 10 cm at 1-km intervals along accessible forest tracks and roads. This allowed us to investigate fox-cat interactions across a gradient of apex predator (fox) activity and other landscape contexts. Prescribed fire is another key management action undertaken throughout both regions (except in very wet sections of Otway Ranges), primarily for asset protection.

In the Glenelg region, Gunditjmara country, natural vegetation--mostly lowland forests and heathy woodlands--is fragmented (Fig. \@ref(fig:occ-map)). Foxes have been subject to lethal control in three distinct forest blocks (separated by pastoral farming and residential property) since October 2005, with 1080 poison-baits replaced fortnightly [@ROBLEY2014262]. Three similar, but unbaited, forest blocks to the north have been surveyed simultaneously as an experimental control [@ROBLEY2014262]. 

The Otway Ranges, Gadubanud country, is a largely continuous patch of natural vegetation with a strong east-west rainfall gradient. A matrix of cool temperate rainforest and wet forest in the high-altitude south-west descends into a large heathland directly north, and into dry forests and then heathlands to the north-east. Foxes are controlled through 1080 poison-baits with monthly replacement across most of the Otway Ranges, but a large section to the north-west remains unbaited. The majority of this baiting began in 2016 - 2017, although fox-baiting commenced in some small sections in 2008.  
 
### Camera-trap surveys
We compiled camera-trap data from three distinct studies across the two regions; totalling 3667 deployments of camera-traps at 1232 camera-trap sites. Camera-traps were active for an average of 47 days, totalling 172,052 trapnights. Camera-trap spacing was variable; the average minimum distance between simultaneously deployed camera-traps was 445, 853 and 1266 metres for each study. Camera-traps were deployed in the Glenelg region between 2013 – 2019, and in the Otway Ranges between 2016 – 2019. 

All camera-trap deployments consisted of a Reconyx (Holmen, Wisconsin) brand camera-trap (both white and infrared flash), attached to a tree or a metal picket, facing a lure. Camera-traps were set-up in two ways depending on the key aim of the project, either targeted toward predators or prey species. One study across both regions positioned camera-traps lower on a tree (around 15 - 30 cm above the ground – angled only slightly downwards) facing a tuna oil lure approximately 2 - 2.5 m away [detailed in @rees2019unexpectedly]. The remaining camera-traps were positioned higher on a tree or a metal picket (at least 40 cm above ground) and angled downwards more strongly - facing a lure approximately 1 - 1.5 m away. These lures consisted of peanut butter, golden syrup and rolled oats mixed into a small ball, placed within a tea strainer or PVC pipe container and secured either to the ground, or 20 - 60 cm above ground on a wooden stake. All set-ups were effective in detecting both predator species.  

### Cumulative detection probabilities
We did not incorporate imperfect detection in the GAMs. To determine the bias this may have had, we calculated the cumulative probability of detection by fitting a single season occupancy-detection model (MacKenzie et al. 2002). We fit these models using the 'unmarked' R-package with 24-hour sampling occasions. We then calculated the calculated the probability that each species would have been detected for a given survey duration [@https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1442-9993.2008.01869.x] of up to 93 days (the maximum survey duration). 

### Generalised additive models of species occurrence   
We constructed a table with a row for each camera-trap deployment, a presence-absence column for each of the four study species, as well as additional columns for site information and explanatory variable values. We modelled occurrence probability for each species (response variable) using binomial generalised additive mixed-effects models implemented in the 'mgcv' R-package [@wood2017generalized]. We specified a model offset to account for differences in camera-trap survey durations and a random intercept for each unique site to account for repeat sampling. We used the same model structure for each species, because we expected all species to be effected by these explanatory variables and we aimed to contrast responses. We used the double penalty model selection approach, which penalises the null space in addition to the range space (i.e. shrinking wiggly terms to linear terms) of the spline basis, meaning covariate effects can be entirely removed from the model [@marra2011practical].

We expected the density of 1080 poison-baits (targeted to foxes) to decrease the fox occurrence probability, and therefore increase the occurrence probability of three subordinate species. We summed the number of fox-baits within a 2.3 km radius around each camera-trap deployment - the average maximum distance foxes in these region travel from their home range centre [@hradsky2017human]. We modelled this explanatory variable using a thin plate regression spline, with a factor smooth basis to model the impact separately for each region: poison-baits are replaced at different frequencies (fortnightly v.s monthly) across the regions, which has been occurring over different time scales (~7-13, 0-3 years) in the Glenelg region and Otway Ranges (respectively). 

We surveyed species across a range of vegetation community types, which provide different levels of food and shelter. However, these resources are mediated by fire, but regeneration following fire occurs occurs at different speeds across vegetation types [@MCCOLLGAUSDEN2019243]. We expect species occurrences to differ across vegetation types and with time since fire, but to have slightly different responses to time since fire in each different vegetation type; we therefore modelled an interaction between time since fire (in years; hereafter 'TSF'). We used coarse fire scar mapping provided by government managers to calculate the years since the last fire for each camera-trap deployment. We attached Ecological Vegetation Class [hereafter 'EVC'; standard units for vegetation classification in Victoria; @delwp2020] groups for each unique camera-trap site, 8 EVC groups in total. We surveyed 20 unique sites in rainforests, which are interspersed (primarily in low lying gullies) throughout wet and damp forests in the south-eastern Otway Ranges. Given the similarity and finescale interspersion of these EVC groups, and that both rarely or never experience fire, we merged them together (hereafter referred to as 'wet forests'). We specified this a hierarchical model structure, which estimated an average TSF response ('global smoother'), along with EVC group-level smoothers with shared wiggliness [i.e. model GS in @pedersen2019hierarchical] This shares information on TSF responses across groups and penalises functions which deviate strongly from the average response--increasing confidence that they are true deviations opposed to the result of sampling noise. 

Invasive predators are well-documented to prefer edges between forest and cleared land (refs). Mammalian prey species are also likely impacted by edges indirectly due to increased invasive predators occurrence probability, and directly due to lower level of proximal suitable habitat (refs). We inverted the Victoria native vegetation extent shapefile from [DELWP]("https://discover.data.vic.gov.au/dataset/native-vegetation-modelled-2005-ecological-vegetation-classes-with-bioregional-conservation-sta"), and removed non-native vegetation areas which were smaller than 30 ha (which Hradsky ref?). For each camera-trap site, we calculated the minimum distance to non-native vegetation area. We used a thin plate regression spline for this smooth. 

All analyses were conducted in R version 3.6.3 [@R].

## Results

Fox occurrence declined with increasing poison-bait density, but this relatively weak effects on the other mammal species (Fig. \@ref(fig:occ-1080)). The maximum poison-bait density, 9 baits per km^2^, reduced fox occurrence probability, consistently across both regions, by ~75% (Fig. \@ref(fig:occ-1080)). This was a linear decline in the Otway region, but a nonlinear shape in Glenelg with diminishing bait returns from 3 - 6 baits km^-2^. We saw no effect on fox control on cat occurrence across both regions. Fox-baiting slightly increased SBB and LNP occurrence in the Glenelg region, but slightly decreased their occurrence in the Otway region. The impact on SBB's was negligible; LNP's in the Glenelg region benefited the most from fox control (Fig. \@ref(fig:occ-1080)c-d).

Threatened species occurrence was most strongly driven by vegetation type and fire (Fig. \@ref(fig:occ-tsf)). Despite being detected across all all vegetation communities, the majority of SBB and LNP detections took place in heathy communities; lowland forests were also important for SBB's, while herb-rich woodlands were also important for LNP's (Table \@ref(tab:occ-naive)). However, within these vegetation communities, occurrence probability varied substantially with TSF for both threatened species. SBB's had the most complex interactions with TSF, with occurrence peaking 20 and 75 years post-fire, although the strength of the 75 year peak varied considerably across vegetation communities. Potoroo occurrence increased linearly with TSF in heathy landscapes, but decreased linearly with TSF in herb-rich woodlands. TSF on this long-term scale had a weak impact on invasive predators, and foxes were also relatively unaffected by EVC group (Fig. \@ref(fig:occ-tsf)). Foxes, cats, and LNP's had a near-flat global function for average TSF. Foxes also had flat functions for TSF in each EVC group, whereas cats and LNP occurrence had variable relationships with TSF across the EVC groups.

Foxes occurrence was high closest to the edge of non-native habitat, and declined linearly into the forest interior for 2 km (Fig. \@ref(fig:occ-dist)a). Cats were mostly unaffected by this fragmentation, whereas SBB and LNP occurrence weakly increased with distance from edges, but these effects were highly uncertain (Fig. \@ref(fig:occ-dist)).

Threatened species had better occurrence model fits than the invasive predators. The generalised additive model of fox occurrence had an adjusted R-square value of 0.29 and explained 28% of the null deviance. Respectively, these model values were 0.25 and 25% for cats; 0.38 and 44% for SBB's; 0.51 and 56% for LNP's. The occupancy-detection models revealed that, for the average camera-trap survey length, species detection probabilities ranged from 70 - 100% (Fig. \@ref(fig:occ-cumdet)). Fox detection probability was high (~95% for the average survey duration) in landscapes without fox control, but considerably lower (~65% for the average survey duration) in landscapes with fox control (assuming constant occupancy). Feral cats had the lowest detection probability. We had near-perfect detection of threatened species on camera-traps with survey durations greater than 30 days (Fig. \@ref(fig:occ-cumdet)).

## Discussion
Here we demonstrate that large reductions in invasive apex predator occurrence don't produce consistent threatened species benefits. For example, a high density of 1080 poison-baits in the Glenelg region, Australia, largely maintains the persistence of LNP's in these landscapes, but appeared to slightly worsen outcomes for this threatened species in the neighbouring Otway Ranges. Fortunately, our work demonstrates that fox control is not the only effective tool mangers have--maintaining optimal fire regimes is a high priority for threatened native mammals in temperate landscapes. However, not only do optimal fire regimes vary across species, but they can be entirely conflicting for the same species across different vegetation communities. Our work highlights the importance of fine-scale monitoring and tailoring conservation strategies to local contexts. 

Ours is the study first to quantify fox suppression across a gradient of 1080 poison-bait densities. Previous studies have not considered how baiting effort varies spatially when analysing the response of foxes and other species, rather averaging across the entire fox control program. There is a huge range in bait densities and replacement schedules for fox control across Australia. Compare to other studies and bait density recommendations. 
The impact of poison-bait densities is relevant to the home-range size of the target species, which for foxes varies considerably (Main et al 2020) - caution needs to be taken when extrapolating to other sites. Ultimately, the best metric for fox control effectiveness is the improvement to native prey persistence. 

Fox-bait density strongly correlated with fox suppression, however, the threatened species we surveyed had weak and inconsistent responses to fox-bait density. SBB's were mostly unaffected. Perhaps this is because bandicoots may more closely follow patterns in cat populations (Catling). On the other hand, LNP's (and other macropods) often benefit the most from fox control (hunter), but only did so in the Glenelg region. The most likely explanation for the lack of positive threatened species responses in the Otway Ranges were because we only surveyed for 0 - 3 years (relative to XX--XX years post-baiting in the Glenelg region) and did not account for time-lag effects. While these species have very short recruitment periods and so have the ability to respond quickly in terms of population density, we assumed that foxes are limiting the availability in suitable habitat for CWR mammals. Rather, we found that vegetation type and TSF were strong drivers of CWR mammal habitat suitability. 

Contrary to the mesopredator release hypothesis, we observed no impact of fox control on cat occurrence probability. This may be because foxes do not suppress feral cat across these region, or because occurrence is too coarse a metric to uncover interactions between these species. Cats were widespread, and of all the species, had the lowest detectability, and the other explanatory variables relatively weak effects on their occurrence. Our occurrence models threw away rich information on detection rates, masking potential behavioural and population density effects.

Our work adds to the growing body of evidence that fire regimes are key to maintaining suitable habitat for small-medium sized native mammals. However, our study demonstrates that species response to fire can vary spatially. For local managers, preserving long unburnt heathy landscapes is a key management priority as they are strongholds for SBBs and LNPs. On the other hand, fresh burns in herb-rich woodland may promote LNP persistence. We saw weaker effects on the generalist invasive predators, contrary to some short-term experiments. This is unsurprising given our coarse, long-term (year) resolution, predator responses to fire and mostly finished within ~3? months. Our result suggests that managers can focus on the heightened threat of invasive predators immediately post-fire (Hradsky refs) rather than over the long-term. 

Invasive predators are well-documented to prefer forest edges, this was true for foxes but not for cats in our study. For foxes, this effect lasted for 2 km into the forest interior, but no effect was detected for cats. GAMs useful for quantifying this, rather than arbitrarily defining categorical edge habitat or assuming edge effects are linear. The weak and uncertain increase in CWR mammal occurrence with distance is intuitive because there is more habitat away from edges, and less foxes. 

While increasing poison-bait density can suppress foxes, Australian threatened native mammals may not benefit unless habitat structure is maintained using careful fire regimes. Failure to account for these changing environmental conditions would have produced substantial noise around the fox control effect. Improved inference will likely come from comparing a range of population metrics, such as behaviour and density.
Invasive predators, fire, as well as changes to rainfall and fire regimes are pervasive biodiversity threats throughout the globe, including within protected areas. However, averaging effects across populations can be misleading because species responses vary.

# Lethal fox control and fire influence the occurrence of invasive predators and threatened native prey {#occ}

## Abstract {-}

Invasive predators and altered fire regimes are key, often overlapping biodiversity threats. Disentangling the impacts of multiple threats and management actions is challenging, particularly when species occur patchily across heterogeneous landscapes. 

Here we assessed the effects of lethal control of an introduced apex predator, the red fox *Vulpes vulpes*, on mammal communities in fire-prone and fragmented forests of south-eastern Australia. Our study synthesised data from multiple smaller-scale studies that used a combination of experimental and space-for-time approaches to monitor the effects of fox control and time since fire, giving a total of 3667 camera-traps deployments across 1232 sites (172,052 trap nights). We used occupancy-detection models to investigate species detectability, and generalised additive models to explore potentially nonlinear effects of multiple drivers and management actions on the distribution of two invasive mammalian predators and two threatened native prey species.

In one region with frequent, long-term (8 - 14 years) targeted poison-baiting of foxes, foxes were heavily suppressed in terms of both detectability and occupancy. There was some evidence feral cat *Felis catus* occupancy was slightly higher in landscapes with fox control, potentially signalling mesopredator release. Fox control increased occupancy rates of long-nosed potoroos *Potorous tridactylus*, but had little effect on occupancy rates of the southern brown bandicoot *Isoodon obesulus*. In another region where fox control recently commenced (0 - 2 years), foxes were suppressed to a lesser extent, and no impacts were detected on subordinate predator or prey species. Fire history impacted the occurrence of each study species, however, invasive predators responded differently to time since fire (0 - 80 years) across each vegetation type. 

Predator control and prescribed fire are important tools that can be used by land managers to manipulate mammalian communities. However, the effectiveness of lethal predator control depends on the intensity and duration of management, and optimal fire regimes differ between species and vegetation types.

## Introduction

Accurate and precise estimates of the effects of management are essential to inform conservation decision-making, ensure cost-effective allocation of resources and identify potential unintended consequences of interventions [@christie2020poor]. However, reliable inference about the effects of landscape-scale management, including identifying the cause of nil or perverse outcomes, is often difficult to achieve because target populations fluctuate naturally and are often subject to multiple co-occurring threats and management actions [@pressey2007conservation; @sugihara2012detecting]. Separating management effects from other drivers is particularly difficult for species that occur patchily across broad distributions [@tulloch2016using]. 

Invasive predator management is a classic example of these challenges. Predators can have devastating impacts on native biodiversity when introduced beyond their native range, and so are often actively controlled using lethal methods [@bellard2016global; @doherty2016invasive; @sih2010predator]. Quantifying the degree of invasive predator suppression, the responses of their native prey and any unintended outcomes across gradients of predator control is key to designing effective, cost-efficient management programs [@walsh2012unexpected; @baxter2008cost; @cattarino2016accounting]. However, the ability of associated monitoring programs to detect these signals is often limited by confounding from co-occurring threats, management actions or natural drivers. This is concerning because few or negative effects on native biodiversity are often observed following invasive predator control, particularly when multiple introduced species are present [@ballari2016potential].

There are several explanations for why native prey species may not benefit from introduced predator control. Firstly, invasive predators may not be suppressed below tolerable thresholds--predators can be remarkably resilient to low-effort culling [@sabo2005stochasticity; @sinclair1998predicting; @moseby2019understanding; @lazenby2015effects]. Secondly, predation by introduced species may not be the primary limit on native prey populations [@banks1999predation]. Thirdly, invasive predator suppression may lead to a 'release' of a subordinate predator [@crooks1999mesopredator; @courchamp1999cats] or competitor species [@ruscoe2011unexpected], which could potentially worsen outcomes [e.g., @rayner2007spatial]. Hence, quantifying the degree of apex predator suppression and testing the mesopredator release hypothesis [@prugh2009rise], are important steps toward understanding prey responses to lethal predator control. 

Quantifying the impacts of planned fire on fauna is similarly complex. Fire can drive the persistence and abundance of fauna populations, primarily through its effects of vegetation structure [@monamy2000small]. These effects persist for decades or centuries, are nonlinear, and vary across environmental conditions [@haslem2011habitat]. Fauna species can have variable responses to fire across heterogeneous landscapes because post-fire regeneration of habitat structure and quality varies across ecological communities and ecological conditions [@swan2015predicting; @nimmo2014why]. Predicting the long-term ramifications of fire on predators and prey is a key challenge for managers who are tasked with stemming the decline of native fauna populations while simultaneously managing fuel loads to protect against the increasing threat of large wildfires [@clarke2008catering; @hradsky2020conserving].

Disentangling the complex and potentially interacting effects of invasive predator and fire management on threatened native fauna is crucial for effective fauna conservation in Australia, which has experienced some of the worst biodiversity declines in recent world history [@doherty2015multiple; @woinarski2019reading; @waldron2017reductions]. Predation by introduced species and altered fire regimes are clearly primary drivers of the declines and contemporary distributions of native mammals [@woinarski2015ongoing], but other threatening processes such as habitat fragmentation, and natural drivers such vegetation type and rainfall dynamics also play an important role [@may1996influence; @hale2016fire]. Lethal red fox *Vulpes vulpes* (hereafter ‘fox’) control and prescribed burning (primarily for asset protection) are among the most common management actions in protected areas, however, we have a poor understanding of effects on native fauna [@lindenmayer2018conservation; @mcleod2008control; @clarke2008catering; @hradsky2020conserving; @braysher2017managing]. This is partly because there is strong spatial overlap of these threats and management actions [@evans2011spatial] and potential unintended consequences often go unmeasured. 

In this study we assessed the effect of two landscape-scale lethal management programs on foxes in fire-prone regions of south-eastern Australia. We quantified the effects of management on foxes (the managed species), feral cats *Felis catus* (hereafter ‘cat’; unmanaged competitor), and two threatened species that are the primary focus of the conservation programs: the southern brown bandicoot *Isoodon obesulus* (hereafter 'SBB') and long-nosed potoroo *Potorous tridactylus* (hereafter 'LNP'). Our study dataset combined experimental and space-for-time approaches to support understanding of the effects of management and other drivers on invasive predator and threatened native prey populations in two regions of southeastern Australia; the Glenelg region and Otway Ranges. Monitoring of the outcomes of management was based on one-off and repeat deployments of 3667 camera-traps across 1232 sites over a period of seven years in protected conservation areas. In the Glenelg region, foxes had been continuously controlled for 8 - 14 years in approximately half of the region and another region where fox control recently commenced (monitored 1 year prior and 2 years following fox control which occurs in approximately 75% of the surveyed region). Occupancy-detection models [@mackenzie2002estimating] were used to investigate the detectability of each species. Occurrence probabilities were also analysed for each species using Generalised Additive Models [hereafter 'GAMs'; @wood2017generalized], which did not account for imperfect detection, but allowed nonlinear responses and more complex interactions between predictor variables. We used GAMs to explore the potentially nonlinear responses of species to fox control effort (1080 poison-bait density), time since fire (0 - 80 years) across vegetation types and other environmental drivers (elevation, terrain ruggedness, recent rainfall, topographic wetness, fragmentation).

## Methods

### Study regions
We compiled data from multiple camera-trap studies across two regions in south-west Victoria, Australia: the Glenelg region and Otway Ranges (Fig. \@ref(fig:occ-map)). Introduced foxes and cats are the only medium-large functional mammalian terrestrial carnivores here: native dingoes *Canis familiaris* are long-absent throughout, while tiger quolls *Dasyurus maculatus* are long-absent in the Glenelg region and likely functionally extinct in the Otway Ranges (last confirmed sighting in 2014). 

#### Glenelg region
In the Glenelg region (38&deg;05'54"S 141&deg;44'41"E), large patches of natural vegetation are fragmented mostly by pastoral farming and residential properties (Fig. \@ref(fig:occ-map)). Here, the primary vegetation communities are heathy woodland, lowland forest, herb-rich woodland and wet heathland [@delwp2020bioregions]. The Glenelg region has an annual mean minimum temperature of 8.1 &deg;C in winter, and 20.0 &deg;C in Summer [@BOM2021]. Mean annual rainfall averages 835 mm [@BOM2021]. Terrain is gently undulating in the Glenelg region; our study sites range from 12 - 180 m above sea level. 

#### Otway Ranges
The Otway Ranges (38&deg;57'82"S 141&deg;68'41"E) is a largely continuous patch of natural vegetation with a strong east-west rainfall gradient (Fig. \@ref(fig:occ-map)). A matrix of cool temperate rainforest and wet forest at high-altitudes (up in the south-west descend into a large heathland directly north, and into dry forests and then heathlands to the north-east. Annual rainfall averages 1955 mm in the southwest, dropping to 627 mm in the eastern Otways [@BOM2021]. Mean minimum temperature in the Otway Ranges is 8&deg; in winter and 13&deg; in summer [@BOM2021]. Our study sites ranged from 23 - 617 m above sea level.

### Fox control and monitoring
In broad sections of each region, government land managers conduct ongoing targeted lethal fox control for biodiversity conservation. Poison-baits containing 3 mg of sodium mono-fluroacetate ('1080') are buried at a depth of 12 - 15 cm at 1-km intervals along accessible forest tracks and roads. Different road densities result in spatially variable densities of poison-bait. Managers also frequently implement prescribed fire across both regions, primarily to reduce fuel loads. 

#### Glenelg region
In the Glenelg region, foxes in three distinct forest blocks have been subject to poison-baiting since October 2005, with fortnightly bait replacements. These forest blocks, along with three similar, unbaited forest blocks to the north are simultaneously surveyed annually under the 'Glenelg Ark' fox control program [40 camera-sites per block; @robley2020glenelg]. Hair-tubes were used to monitor small prey species from 2005 - 2013 [presented in @robley2014long], replaced by camera-traps from 2013 onwards [here we present camera-trap data from 2013 - 2019; @robley2020glenelg]. We also included a further 425 camera-trap deployments at unique locations from early 2018 (M.W.R., PhD surveys). This totals 2039 camera-trap deployments in the Glenelg region, collected in a control-impact experimental design (foxes had been continuously controlled for at 8 - 14 years in the treatment landscapes by the time of these surveys). 

#### Otway Ranges
Fox-baiting commenced in small sections of the Otway Ranges in 2008 and large-scale systematic baiting began in 2016 - 2017 under the 'Otway Ark' program [@robley2019otway]. For the first six weeks, poison-baits were replaced weekly, then changing to ongoing monthly bait-replacement. There was a pause in baiting for approximately six months during the second half of 2018. Fox control recommenced in late 2018 with four weeks of fortnightly bait-replacement, before returning to monthly bait-replacement. A large section of the Otway Ranges to the north-west remains unbaited, but is monitored as an experimental non-treatment site [@robley2019otway]. Otway Ark managers survey 372 camera-trap sites annually (sequentially across the region); we present one 'before' baiting survey and two 'after' baiting surveys of each site from 2016 - 2018, totalling 1113 camera-trap deployments [@robley2019otway]. We also include data from an additional before-after control-impact surveys (one 'before' baiting survey and two 'after' bating surveys) in the western section of the Otway Ranges, conducted annually 2017 - 2019 (M.W.R PhD surveys). This added a further 195 sites and 524 camera-trap deployments. 
 
#### Camera-trap set-ups
All camera-trap deployments consisted of a Reconyx (Holmen, Wisconsin) brand camera-trap (white or infrared flash), attached to a tree or a metal picket, facing a lure. The Glenelg Ark and Otway Ark fox monitoring programs positioned camera-traps  at least 40 cm above ground on a tree or a metal picket and angled more strongly downwards toward a lure approximately 1 - 1.5 m away [@robley2020glenelg; @robley2019otway]. The lures consisted of peanut butter, golden syrup and rolled oats mixed into a small ball, placed within a tea strainer or PVC pipe container and secured either to the ground, or 20 - 60 cm above ground on a wooden stake. The M.W.R. PhD surveys across both regions positioned camera-traps lower on a tree (around 15 - 30 cm above the ground) angled only slightly downwards towards  a tuna oil lure approximately 2 - 2.5 m away [detailed in @rees2019unexpectedly]. Camera-traps were active for an average of 47 days (maximum 93 days), totalling 172,052 trap-nights.

#### Study species
Foxes and feral cats are both introduced to Australia and share a similar functional niche [@glen2005complex], competing for many of the same prey species [@woinarski2021compounding; @stobo2021reptiles; @stobo2021sharing]. LNPs and SBBs are both solitary, medium-sized, ground-dwelling marsupials. They nest in dense understorey vegetation during the day and turn over large quantities of soil to feed on invertebrates, plant material and fungi at night [@van2008mammals]. 
 

### Occupancy-detection models
We first modelled species occupancy probabilities using occupancy-detection models [@mackenzie2002estimating] implemented in a Bayesian framework using 'stan' [@carpenter2017stan] via the 'ubms' R-package [@ubms]. For each species, we fit a 'stacked' single-season model: repeat surveys were considered as additional sites and pseudoreplication accounted for by using a random-intercept for each unique site. We defined survey occasions as 24-hour periods commencing at midday. We modelled the effect of fox control (categorical: baited or unbaited) on species occupancy and detectability, and included an interaction term with region to account for potentially different responses in the Glenelg and Otway regions. This approach allowed combination of the regional datasets, increasing statistical power to detect smaller effects and precision of parameter estimates. We fit models with four MCMC chains each with 10,000 iterations (including a 5000-iteration warm-up phase). To determine whether detection probabilities for these surveys were high enough to justify analysis with generalised additive models (which do not account for imperfect detections), we calculated cumulative detection probabilities for camera-trap survey lengths [@garrard2008when] from one to 93 days (maximum survey duration).


### Generalised additive models 
We modelled species occurrence probabilities using binomial GAMs implemented in the ‘mgcv’ R-package [@wood2017generalized]. The use of GAMS has the advantage of allowing modelling of non-parametric and nonlinear relationships between occurrence and explanatory variables, which is particularly important for estimating time since fire responses [@haslem2011habitat]. Relative to occurrence-detection models, GAMs allow more complex model structures to be fit in a computationally efficient framework, but assume perfect detection. For the most part, we considered this a reasonable assumption; the occurrence-detection models revealed high (> 75%) cumulative detection probabilities based on our average camera-trap survey effort for each species across baited and unbaited landscapes for each region, except for cats in the Glenelg region (see results for details). 

Our GAMs used a binary occupied-unoccupied response variable for each entire camera-trap deployment. To account for differences in survey duration, we specified a model offset for the log-transformed survey duration (number of days), as well as a random intercept for each unique camera-site to account for repeat sampling. We used the double penalty model selection approach, which penalises model complexity both in terms of the model structure (variables included) and the shapes (wiggliness) of the relationships between the dependent and independent variables included in the model [@marra2011practical]. We used the same model structure and explanatory variables, for each species, as detailed in the sections below.

#### 1080 poison-bait density
Poison-baits are deployed by land managers to suppress foxes with the aim of benefiting native prey.  However, cats may also benefit from fox control as they are subordinate competitors to foxes [@marlow2015lethal; @hunter2018not]. The degree of fox suppression is a function of the spatial arrangement of poison baits (i.e., poison-bait density) relative to fox home-range size, as well as the frequency of bait replacement [@fleming1996ground; @benshemesh2020citizen]. In the Otway and Glenelg regions, adult foxes travel an average maximum distance of 2.3 km from their home-range centre [@hradsky2017human]. Therefore, to examine the effects of lethal control effort we summed the number of poison-bait stations within a 2.3 km radius around each camera-trap deployment. Densities ranged from 0 - 19 baits per 16.1 km^2^ circle (2.3 km radius): mean: 10 and eight baits per fox home-range in fox-baited landscapes in the Glenelg region and Otway Ranges, respectively. For an easier comparison to other studies, we converted these values to baits per square kilometre. We modelled a function of 1080 poison-bait density with separate responses per region. In wet weather conditions, some poison-bait stations become inaccessible and baits do not get replaced, but we did not account for this because we lacked specific information. There was also an approximate six month pause in bait replacements in the Otway Ranges that we did not account for because it would have ignored prior fox suppression.


#### Fire and vegetation type
We modelled an interaction between time since fire (in years; hereafter ‘TSF’) and vegetation type as we expected species occurrence to (i) differ across vegetation types, (ii) respond to TSF, and (iii) have variable responses to TSF in each vegetation type [as post-fire regeneration occurs at different speeds; @swan2015predicting]. We also expected species to respond to fire frequency, as this can have a strong effect on vegetation structure [@collins2012can]. 

We derived fire frequency (the number of previous fires) and time since last fire (in years) for each camera trap deployment using coarse fire scar mapping provided by government managers, dating back to 1939 when large wildfires burnt both regions extensively. The most frequently burnt sites (n = 2) had experienced eight fires since 1939 (mean 1.5 fires), 397 sites had not burnt since 1939. We identified the Ecological Vegetation Class group [hereafter 'vegetation type'; standard units for vegetation classification in Victoria; @delwp2020bioregions] for each unique camera-trap site, totalling eight vegetation types. We only surveyed 20 unique sites in rainforests, which are interspersed (primarily in low lying gullies) throughout wet and damp forests in the south-eastern Otway Ranges. Given the similarity, fine-scale interspersion of these EVC groups, and that both rarely or never experience fire, we merged them together (hereafter referred to as 'wet forests').

We specified the TSF and vegetation type interaction with a hierarchical model structure, which estimated an average TSF response along with separate responses to TSF in each vegetation type [model ‘GS’ detailed in @pedersen2019hierarchical]. This shares information on TSF responses and wiggliness across EVC groups, penalising functions which deviate strongly from the average response that are not substantially supported by the observation data. We initially fit a separate smooth for fire frequency, however, this had high concurvity with TSF (causing a lack of identifiability) and so we removed the fire frequency variable from all models. 

#### Elevation, topographic ruggedness and wetness
We modelled the effect of elevation, as well as indexes of topographic ruggedness and wetness (both derived from a digital elevation model) on species occurrences. Elevation is a strong driver of rainfall, moisture and temperature gradients, likely indirectly impacting the distribution of study species through resource availability. High topographic complexity (i.e., 'ruggedness') can limit predator movement and predation rates, thereby benefiting prey [@hohnen2016occupancy; @stobo2020habitat; @mckenzie2007analysis; @mcdonald2017habitat]. Soil moisture (estimated by the topographic wetness index) impacts vegetation, as well as the availability of subterranean invertebrates and fungi - key food sources for the LNP and SBB [@lobert1990home; @nuske2017redundancy].

We extracted the elevation above sea level (metres) of each site using a 10-m resolution digital elevation model [@delwp2020elevation]. We also used this elevation layer to calculate the median terrain ruggedness index [calculates the difference in elevation between a central cell and eight adjacent cells; @riley1999index], taking the median value in a 30-m radius around each camera-trap site. The topographic wetness index estimates where water will accumulate by accounting for topographic influences on hydrological processes [@beven1979physically]. We also took the median topographic wetness index in a 30-m radius around each camera-trap site, derived from a 30-m resolution layer [@gallant2012topographic]. We modelled the effect of elevation, topographic ruggedness and wetness on species occurrences across both regions. 

#### Proximity to forest edge 
Invasive predators are well-documented to prefer edges between forest and cleared land as they facilitate efficient movement and hunting [@hradsky2017human; @nichols2019evaluation; @may1996influence]. We therefore modelled the effect of the minimum distance from each camera-trap site to the nearest area of non-native vegetation. We calculated this by inverting the extent of native vegetation [@NV2005_EVCBCS] and removing cleared areas smaller than 30 ha [@geary2020predators].

#### Recent rainfall
Changes in short-term rainfall dynamics likely impact both invasive predator and native prey species [@greenville2014bottom; @wilson2012terrestrial; @paull2013fragmentation; @arthur2012relative]. We therefore calculated the percentage difference in rainfall from the long-term median that had occurred prior to the start of each camera-trap survey in six, 12, 18 and 24 month periods. We used rainfall data from the nearest weather station [n = 11; @BOM2021] for each camera-trap. We modelled rainfall effects separately for each region. To identify the most appropriate rainfall window (six – 24 months) for each species, we fit a separate model (including all explanatory variables previously mentioned) using each rainfall window and selected the top-ranked model using Akaike Information Criterion (hereafter 'AIC') scores [@burnham2004multimodel]. 

All analyses were conducted in R version 3.6.3 [@R].

## Results

### Red fox
Foxes were detected on 1453 of the 3667 camera-traps surveys (39.6%; Table \@ref(tab:occ-naive)).

#### Occupancy-detection models
Fox detectability in unbaited landscapes was high, particularly in the Glenelg region (Fig. \@ref(fig:occ-det)a) where 95% detection probability was reached after a 30 day survey duration (relative to 64 days in the Otway Ranges; Fig. \@ref(fig:occ-cumdet)). Fox control reduced fox detectability across both regions. Nonetheless, foxes in baited landscapes still had a high detection probability for the average survey duration (47 days): 76% in the Glenelg region and 81% in the Otway Ranges (Fig. \@ref(fig:occ-cumdet)). 

The occupancy-detection model estimated fox occupancy to be lower at sites in baited landscapes than unbaited landscapes; this effect was more than twice as strong in the Glenelg region than the Otway Ranges (Fig. \@ref(fig:occ-det)b). For example, in heathy woodlands of the Glenelg region, fox occupancy probability was approximately three times lower in baited landscapes (0.19; 95% CI 0.13 - 0.26) relative to unbaited landscapes (0.56; 95% CI: 0.47 - 0.66). Whereas in the heathy woodlands of the Otway Ranges, fox occupancy was already low without fox control (0.33; 95% CI: 0.25 - 0.43) and was approximately 1.4 times lower following fox control (0.24; 95% CI 0.17 - 0.33). Foxes were ubiquitous across the study regions, but the probability of occupancy was nearly twice as high in dry forests, herb-rich woodlands and lowland forests than heathlands, heathy woodlands and wet forests (Fig. \@ref(fig:occ-det)c). 

#### Generalised additive models
The GAM showed that fox-bait density in the Glenelg region was the strongest driver of fox occurrence. Fox occurrence in the Glenelg region declined from a probability of 0.68 (95% CI: 0.58 - 0.76) where fox-bait density was zero, to 0.04 (95% CI: 0.02 - 0.11) where fox-bait density was highest (1.14 baits km^-2^; Fig. \@ref(fig:gams-occ-fox)a). The effect of fox-bait density on foxes in the Glenelg region was nonlinear: there was little difference in fox occurrence across the range of 0.4 to 0.8 baits km^-2^ in Glenelg, but a greater suppression was achieved at higher bait densities (Fig. \@ref(fig:gams-occ-fox)a). Fox occurrence also declined with fox-bait density in the Otway Ranges, but this effect was linear, weaker and had higher uncertainty (Fig. \@ref(fig:gams-occ-fox)a). Fox occurrence in the Otway Ranges declined from a probability of 0.4 (95% CI: 0.32 - 0.48) where fox-bait density was zero, to 0.14 (95% CI: 0.05 - 0.35) where fox-bait density was highest (1.1 baits km^-2^; Fig. \@ref(fig:gams-occ-fox)a).

Foxes declined linearly with increasing terrain ruggedness and distance to non-native vegetation for up to 1.5 - 2 km (Fig. \@ref(fig:gams-occ-fox)d;f). Elevation had a nonlinear and uncertain effect on fox occurrence, which was estimated to peak around 450 m above sea level (Fig. \@ref(fig:gams-occ-fox)c). The effect of topographic wetness on fox occurrence was removed from the model (Fig. \@ref(fig:gams-occ-fox)e). There was no average TSF response on fox occurrence, however, fox occurrence declined linearly with TSF in dry forests and increased linearly with TSF in heathland, although there was considerable uncertainty in these estimates (Fig. \@ref(fig:gams-occ-fox)g:h). The fox GAM that considered rainfall deviations in the previous 6 months was ranked highest relative to models with 18- (by only 1.4 AIC units), 12-, and 24-month periods (by at least 6.4 AIC units; Table. \@ref(tab:occ-rain-aic), however, this effect was weak with relatively high uncertainty (Fig. \@ref(fig:gams-occ-fox)c). The top-ranked fox GAM had an adjusted R-square value of 0.27 and explained 26% of the null deviance. 
  
  
### Feral cat
Cats were detected on 1010 camera-trap deployments (27.6%; Table \@ref(tab:occ-naive)). 

#### Occupancy-detection models
Cats were relatively poorly detected in the Glenelg region, where they had a 59% detection probability for the average survey duration, compared to 83% in the Otway Ranges; Fig. \@ref(fig:occ-cumdet)). There was no detectability difference between fox control treatment landscapes in the Glenelg region, however, cat detectability was slightly higher with fox control in the Otway Ranges (Fig. \@ref(fig:occ-det)a). 

The occupancy-detection models estimated that cat occupancy in the Glenelg region was higher in landscapes with fox control (0.25 in heathy woodlands; 95% CI: 0.16 - 0.35 in heathy woodlands) relative to those without fox control (0.12 in heathy woodlands; 95% CI: 0.07 - 0.19); but there was no association with baiting in the Otway Ranges (Fig. \@ref(fig:occ-det)b). Cat occupancy was most strongly driven by vegetation type: highest in the wet forest, followed by heathland, swampy scrub, herb-rich woodland and dry forest, but very low in lowland forest and heathy woodland (Fig. \@ref(fig:occ-det)c). 

#### Generalised additive models
The cat GAM showed no effect of fox-bait density, elevation or topographic wetness on cat occurrence (Fig. \@ref(fig:gams-occ-cat)a;c;e). Cats responded to TSF differently across each vegetation type, with the average TSF response removed from the model (Fig. \@ref(fig:gams-occ-cat)g:h). Cat occurrence probability increased with terrain ruggedness, and declined with distance from the nearest area of non-native vegetation, although uncertainty was high (Fig. \@ref(fig:gams-occ-cat)d;f). All cat GAMs were indistinguishable based on AIC scores. The model which considered rainfall deviations in the previous six months explained slightly more variation in cat occupancy (0.7 AIC units lower) than models considering rainfall over longer time periods (Table. \@ref(tab:occ-rain-aic)), estimating that cat occurrence slightly increased as rainfall increased (relative to the long-term average; Fig. \@ref(fig:gams-occ-cat)c). All other GAMs had the rainfall variable removed. The top-ranked cat GAM had an adjusted R-square value of 0.24 and explained 24% of the null deviance.  

 
### Southern brown bandicoot
We detected SBBs on 394 of the 3667 camera-traps (10.7%; Table \@ref(tab:occ-naive)). 

#### Occupancy-detection models
SBBs were highly detectable, with a greater than 95% detection probability reached after 31 and 43 days in the Glenelg and Otway Ranges, respectively (Fig. \@ref(fig:occ-cumdet)). Baiting was associated with a decrease in SBB detectability in Glenelg but an increase in detectability in the Otways (Fig. \@ref(fig:occ-det)a). 

There was no discernible effect of fox control on SBB occupancy in either region (Fig. \@ref(fig:occ-det)b). SBB's were most likely to occupy heathy woodlands (Fig. \@ref(fig:occ-det)c) and they were largely absent from the wet forests (Table \@ref(tab:occ-naive)). The few SBB detections in wet forest occurred at sites adjacent to other vegetation types (SBBs are largely replaced by long-nosed bandicoots *Perameles nasuta* in wet forest; M. Rees, unpublished data). 

#### Generalised additive models
SBB occurrence probability was very low. There was some indication SBB occurrence slightly increased with fox-bait density in the Glenelg region, peaked around 150 m above sea level and 2 km from the nearest forest edge, declined with increasing terrain ruggedness and TSF, however, these explanatory variables had high uncertainty relative to the strength of the effects (Fig. \@ref(fig:gams-occ-sbb)). There was no evidence that rainfall affected SBB occurrence – the top-ranked models in terms of AIC scores (Table. \@ref(tab:occ-rain-aic)) had the effects of rainfall completely removed. The top-ranked SBB GAMs had an adjusted R-square value of 0.31 and explained 41% of the null deviance.  


### Long-nosed potoroo
We detected LNPs on 331 camera-trap deployments (9%; Table \@ref(tab:occ-naive)). 

#### Occupancy-detection models
LNPs were the most detectable of our study species, reaching a 95% detection probability with a 33 and 18 day survey duration in the unbaited landscapes of the Glenelg and Otway regions, respectively (Fig. \@ref(fig:occ-cumdet)). In the Glenelg region, LNP detectability was twice as high in landscapes with fox control relative to those without (Fig. \@ref(fig:occ-det)a). Occupancy of LNPs was highest in heathlands (Fig. \@ref(fig:occ-det)c).

#### Generalised additive models
The GAM showed that LNP occupancy improved from a 0.05 occurrence probability (95% CI: 0.02 - 0.11) to 0.33 (95% CI: 0.16 - 0.55) across the fox-bait density gradient in the Glenelg region (Fig. \@ref(fig:gams-occ-lnp)a). In contrast, LNP occupancy decreased slightly with poison-bait density in the Otway region (although confidence intervals were wide; Fig. \@ref(fig:gams-occ-lnp)a). LNP occurrence probability increased linearly with elevation (Fig. \@ref(fig:gams-occ-lnp)c) and peaked in the mid-range of topographic wetness (Fig. \@ref(fig:gams-occ-lnp)e). LNP occurrence was low initially after fire, but peaked around 20 years and remained steady in the years afterwards, although there was considerably uncertainty (Fig. \@ref(fig:gams-occ-lnp)e). There was no discernable differences in LNP TSF responses across the vegetation types (Fig. \@ref(fig:gams-occ-lnp)f). The rainfall term was removed for the top-ranked model (at least 3.5 AIC units higher than the other rainfall periods), which had an adjusted R-square value of 0.47 and explained 53% of the null deviance.

## Discussion

Here we found that consistent and long-term lethal control can reduce a widespread invasive apex predator (fox) to a near-zero occurrence probability--and importantly--increase the occurrence probability of a threatened prey species (LNP) by more than 6-fold (Fig. \@ref(fig:gams-occ-fox)a; Fig. \@ref(fig:gams-occ-lnp)a). However, prey responses to predator suppression are not universal [@hunter2018not; @duncan2020eruptive; @salo2010predator]. Despite initial signs of improvement in the Glenelg region [@robley2014long], SBB occupancy was mostly unaffected by fox control in our study (Fig. \@ref(fig:occ-det)b; Fig. \@ref(fig:gams-occ-lnp)a). This may have been because feral cat occupancy was twice as high in the landscapes with fox control relative to those without in the Glenelg region (Fig. \@ref(fig:occ-det)b), potentially signalling mesopredator release. In another region where fox control recently commenced with less frequent baiting, foxes were suppressed to a lesser extent and neither threatened prey species showed signs of improvement (Fig. \@ref(fig:occ-det)b; Fig. \@ref(fig:gams-occ-fox)a; Fig. \@ref(fig:gams-occ-sbb)a; Fig. \@ref(fig:gams-occ-lnp)a). Our study demonstrates that lethal invasive predator control can be a highly effective conservation strategy, but only for some species and when sustained continuously over the long-term.

The Glenelg Ark program has continuously controlled foxes across approximately 100 000 ha of public land since 2005 [@robley2014long] and is one of the few fox control programs in Australia to demonstrate a sustained reduction in fox occupancy [see also @stobo2020management]. A reduction in fox occupancy is a strong sign of management effectiveness because it means prey are less exposed to the threat of predation. Our study provides empirical evidence that the effectiveness of fox control from poison-baiting programs depends on the density of poison-baits deployed (Fig. \@ref(fig:gams-occ-fox)a). This has only previously been inferred by comparing fox baiting programs across different regions (where fox ecology, environmental conditions and study designs differ). The densities of poison-baits in our study regions (maximum 1.14 baits km^-2^) were far below the recommended 5 - 10 baits km^-2^ [mostly derived from studies in arid and semi-arid regions; @saunders2007improving], but nonetheless effective at fox suppression in the Glenelg region (Fig. \@ref(fig:occ-det)b). Controlling foxes with 0.1 - 0.3 baits km^-2^ was particularly effective in the Glenelg region, reducing fox occurrence by up to four-fold; higher poison-bait densities suppressed fox occurrence to a lesser extent (Fig. \@ref(fig:gams-occ-fox)a). Increased bait caching at high bait densities may explain why fox suppression tapered off, which is likely to result in a sublethal dose when eventually consumed and potential bait aversion [@saunders2007improving]. Nonetheless, benefits to threatened native prey is the best metric of fox control effectiveness. The probability of LNP occurrence increased linearly with poison-bait density in the Glenelg region (Fig. \@ref(fig:gams-occ-lnp)a), confirming that high fox control effort leads to improved conservation outcomes.

We slightly underestimated the effect of bait density across both regions because the models assumed all bait-stations were constantly active, despite some bait-replacements being missed due to accessibility issues following wet weather events or because of more pressing management concerns (namely wildfire). We more strongly underestimated the effect of bait density in the Otway Ranges because we also did not account for the near six month pause in bait replacement in 2018. We also expect fox-baits to be less effective in the Otway Ranges than the Glenelg region due to the high average rainfall which more quickly degrades the poison [@gentle2007persistence; @saunders2000degradation]. Nonetheless, fox occupancy in the Otway Ranges was still negatively associated with fox-bait density (Fig. \@ref(fig:gams-occ-fox)a), suggesting that intensified and sustained fox control is likely to be effective in that region. Future research will benefit from accounting for the role of environmental conditions and prey availability on baiting effectiveness [@carter2013fox; @saunders2007improving], as well as interference with baits by non-target species [@glen2003monitoring; @fairbridge2000observations; @marlow2015lethal].

Evidence that fox control caused a mesopredator release of feral cats in terms of detectability and occupancy was mixed. Cat detectability increased with fox control in the Otway Ranges, and cat occupancy was higher in sites with fox control in the Glenelg region (Fig. \@ref(fig:occ-det)a:b). However, cat occurrence did not change across gradients of poison-bait density in either region (GAM; Fig. \@ref(fig:gams-occ-cat)a). Cat detectability in the Glenelg region was very low (Fig. \@ref(fig:occ-det)a), and so the model assumption of perfect detection in the cat GAM was likely problematic. This result could also signal that cats respond to fox suppression at the landscape level rather than at finer spatial scale. In addition, potential changes in population density and behaviour following mesopredator release [@brashares2010ecological], such as cats reducing their ranging behaviour following fox control [as found by @molsher2017mesopredator], could skew inference around occupancy estimates [@efford2012occupancy; @broadley2019density; @stewart2018species; @neilson2018animal; @mccarthy2013influence]. Cats had weak associations with most explanatory variables, the poorest detection rates and worst model fits of our study species, further highlighting the challenges of monitoring this elusive, generalist predator [@fisher2015cat; @stokeld2015multiple; @algar2020feral].

In the Glenelg region, LNP--but not SBB--occupancy improved with fox control (Fig. \@ref(fig:occ-det)b). Monitoring prey occupancy to measure the effectiveness of predator control rests on the assumption that there is suitable habitat for prey to expand into. While SBBs had a narrower distribution relative to LNPs across our study regions (largely absent from the wet forests), there was 34 heathy woodland sites in the Glenelg region where they were never observed (from 196 camera-trap deployments), suggesting there was suitable habitat for them to colonise. There may have been a variable which precluded SBB presence at these 34 sites, most likely habitat structure [@swan2015predicting], although @smith2013fire found no association between habitat structure and SBB occupancy in the 240 Glenelg Ark monitoring sites. Instead, the different prey responses in our study most likely reflect the relative vulnerability of these species to fox and cat predation: LNPs (and other small macropods) appear more strongly limited by fox predation, whereas SBBs tend to be more closely associated with cat populations [@hunter2018not; @arthur2012relative] and so may have experienced negative consequences from higher cat occupancy in landscape with fox control. This would also help explain why SBB occupancy was highest in heathy woodlands, where cat occupancy is lowest (Fig. \@ref(fig:occ-det)c). Formally testing whether invasive predator occupancy impacts the probability of prey occupancy using multispecies models [@rota2016multispecies] is a priority for future research. 

In the Otway Ranges, fox control did not improve SBB or LNP occupancy (Fig. \@ref(fig:occ-det)b; Fig. \@ref(fig:gams-occ-sbb)a); Fig. \@ref(fig:gams-occ-lnp)a). This is unsurprising given fox suppression in the Otway Ranges was weak, likely because fox control had only recently commenced and bait replacements were inconsistent (relative to the Glenelg region). Despite the high fecundity of these prey species, two years was may have been insufficient time to measure an effect of fox control on prey occupancy. Additionally, we averaged fox control effects over a 0 - 2 year time period in the Otway ranges, although, our findings concur with those of @robley2019otway, who estimated annual occupancy probabilities using a more traditional BACI analysis with a subset of this data. Fortunately, the ongoing broadscale monitoring of the Otway Ark fox control program and other local initiatives will shed light on occupancy trends over time.

Fire can have long-term impacts on the occurrence of small-medium sized native mammals [@monamy2000small; @claridge2000factors; @arthur2012relative]. Previously, @smith2013fire found extinction probabilities for both LNPs and SBB's to be high for up to 18 months post-fire. Here we found that, for individuals which persisted through the initial burn period, LNP occurrence improved and peaked in 20 years post-fire (Fig. \@ref(fig:gams-occ-lnp)g). However, seemingly contrary to @smith2013fire, SBB occurrence declined with increasing TSF (Fig. \@ref(fig:gams-occ-sbb)g). Given the uncertainty around our estimates and importance for managers implementing prescribed fire, further research is required to clarify and understand the mechanisms behind these responses to fire. A key question remaining in particular is whether fox control impacts prey responses to fire in the short and long-term. 

Our work adds to the small body of evidence that fire patterns can impact the occurrence of predators [@geary2020predator]. While there is now considerable research which has demonstrated that invasive predator impacts are heightened in recently burnt areas [@hradsky2017human; @hradsky2017responses; @mcgregor2014landscape; @leahy2016amplified; @green2006immediate; @meek2000home; @mcgregor2016extraterritorial], we have a comparitively poor understanding of how long-term fire patterns impact invasive predators [reviewed in @hradsky2020conserving]. Similar to previous studies, we found no average response to TSF for foxes or cats, however, both predators had varying responses to TSF across vegetation types (Fig. \@ref(fig:gams-occ-fox)g:h; Fig. \@ref(fig:gams-occ-cat)g:h;). This supports the 'dynamic vegetation' hypothesis [@nimmo2014why]; the first evidence of this kind for predators (although, uncertainty around these estimates was high). Studies often merge similar vegetation types due to some groups having small sample sizes, however, we found no clear way of grouping vegetation types that was relevant to multiple species. Our hierarchical specification of the TSF and vegetation type interaction was powerful in this regard as it allowed separate responses for each vegetation type, while sharing information across vegetation types [and providing confidence that there was data to back-up differently shaped responses given the penalisation to the average response; @pedersen2019hierarchical]. 

Accounting for other drivers of species in models that estimate responses to management is critical, but not often undertaken. For example, unexpected declines and local extinctions of small-medium sized mammals have occurred following 40 years of fox control in south-west Western Australia [thought to be the result of a mesopredator release of cats; @wayne2017recoveries], but the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has identified this region as a 'drying hotspot' [@drying2021kala] and there are strong concerns around the intensity of prescribed fire operations [e.g., @bennett2021prescribed], offering alternative explanations for prey declines. Mammal communities have also collapsed following long-term fox-control in Booderee National Park [@lindenmayer2018conservation], although a severe wildlife burnt through approximately half the region in the same year fox control commenced [leaving greater than 73% of park burnt within the last decade; @foster2017effects]. Similarly, recent fire events have, by chance, been skewed towards the baited landscapes  of the Glenelg region since fox control began, with the majority of long-unburnt vegetation occurring in unbaited landscapes (Fig. \@ref(fig:veg-tsf-violin)). We were able to compensate for this confounding by also including an additional 424 sites in the Glenelg region, as well as the Otway Ranges datasets--providing a wider range of fire history patterns in each vegetation type with and without fox control (Fig. \@ref(fig:veg-tsf-violin)). Our study demonstrates the value of bringing together multiple smaller datasets to compare management effectiveness. 

Occurrence models are powerful tools to predict species distributions but less useful for explaining fine-scale site-use for wide-ranging, generalist species in continuous habitat [@guillera2015my; @efford2012occupancy]. Despite our large dataset, uncertainty for most explanatory variables was high. Our study offers little additional clarity about the 'natural' drivers of occurrence for invasive predators and medium-sized mammalian prey within their distributions other than clarifying the importance of broad vegetation type. While we did seek to provide inference on drivers these species, our key aim was to account for confounding variables while testing fox control effects. Nevertheless, testing the predictive performance of distribution models for these species, in particular whether region-specific or across-region models predict more accurately will aid the management of these species.  

Fox control is a major expenditure of Australian conservation and agricultural programs [approximately AUD 16 million annually; @mcleod2004counting]. It is critical to ensure cost-effectiveness from both a monetary and ethical standpoint. Here we demonstrate that effectiveness in terms of fox suppression is a function of control effort, although evidence of benefits to native prey species were mixed in this study. Prey may not benefit from predator control if mesopredator release of other invasive predators occurs or if prey are constrained by other factors such as lack of suitable habitat. Species vulnerable to fox predation are also sensitive to fire-induced changes in habitat structure [@woinarski2015ongoing], and so integrating conservation strategies which consider habitat and invasive predator management in concert is a future priority. Our work highlights the importance of fine-scale monitoring, considering multiple drivers and tailoring conservation strategies to local contexts.
